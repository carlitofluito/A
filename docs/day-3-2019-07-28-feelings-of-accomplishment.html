<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> DAY 3 – 2019-07-28 – Feelings of accomplishment</h1>
<p>“Woman!” was the first thing I told you that morning. I woke up sleep deprived. Stressing out about the “Truth News”. Excited for having the possibility of sharing a message that I wanted to share and placating my blaming my tendencies of overworking and taking too much responsibility. In less than 40 minutes we were able to finish the script, communicating what we wanted to do to the social committee, soothing down Mari Trini’s stress, and convincing Miriam to give us the floor. We even envision a small performance where you were the assistant giving me water while I spoke. So meaningful, symbolic, and archetypical already. The man changing the world, and the woman behind supporting him and keeping him alive. I would have liked it to be more equal, to share the speech with you, but the rush and your agreement made us choose the most efficient outcome. People in general liked the performance, Miriam told us to repeat it every morning, which was the idea I had on mind. Unlucky me, I couldn’t predict that people would feel offended and attacked by me talking about fruits. Another lesson, Carlos, another lesson.</p>
<p>The day went on. The facilitators mentioned that the journalist they had arranged to come wasn’t coming. A big fucked up for an organization, but I never liked to catch a big fish in a small bucket. Too easy for me. Participants had complained the day before. Facilitators had muted us. Then, they had revealed themselves. We argued a bit about terms like scoops, information and news. I didn’t want to become too quarrelsome, I wanted to keep it cool and control myself. There was no point on discussing about words. But few unfortunate comments and the huge misinterpretation that a video in French with automatic subtitles generated by YouTube set me a bit on fire. I managed to speak my voice a couple of times, making clear that different languages, cultures and backgrounds were the origin of many potential confusions. I also protected Google and the Internet, because, you know, planet Earth in 2019. (You had also mentioned the day before that the two things you felt most grateful in your life were the Internet and the European Union because, you know, human nature during your childhood).</p>
<p>At some point along the morning, I discovered that Holly was being expelled. I tried to wake her up a couple of times, to make her participate, to save her. She had mentioned the previous night that she believed on me, that she has seen authenticity on me, that I wasn’t a fake “happy type”, that I was something more real. I had found a believer, and believers are to be protected. But talking with Sonia and some other facilitators looked like the ultimate decision had been already taken. Holly was leaving, and Tiberiu was leaving with her. It hurt. It hurt the fact that I couldn’t do anything to avoid it. It hurt the fact that our voice wasn’t listened. It hurt the unfairness of the situation. It hurt that they weren’t going to have an opportunity of saying goodbye to us. Sonia told me that they would say goodbye to those that they wanted. It hurt to let go two of the people I have realized I could connect most with. And still, they went. They left during an activity to avoid disturbing the group and creative bad vibes according to the organizers. That was extremely badly done, that was extremely unprofessional, of an extreme low quality. Organizers kept on reveling themselves. That was the way they were solving problems: kicking people out in second day. My lesson again was to surrender, to accept the situation, to stop fighting. I had fought so much the previous day arranging the rooms, confronting the disbelief and discouragement of many, that I felt that I shouldn’t keep on going with the strategy further. I felt that pressing too much wasn’t the best, at least that earlier. The situation was already tense, and Sonia had mentioned that the decision came from above. Etienne and his old-school teaching attitude seemed inflexible to me as well. It was a lost battle. A battle that had been fought without me. A battle that I had missed. A battle where I hadn’t had the opportunity of intervening.</p>
<p>Holly left. Tiberiu left. I kept on learning my lessons: acceptance, compassion, surrender. I thought that Holly would learn her lesson and that the next time she would be more loving, and less alcoholic. I learned my lesson, and I decided that my voice had to be listened more often. I wrote about patience; I shared it with you. Somehow you were there all the time, supporting me, listening to me, giving me feedback, improving myself and helping me grow. In the coffee break I had looked for you exclusively to apologize for having told you “Woman!” the first thing in the morning. You didn’t care for it, but for me it felt right to do it, since you were the human being, the person, the woman that was actually supporting and caring the most for what I was trying to do. Your presence, your water.</p>
<p>The day continued. Same tempo, and same rushing attitude all the time. No time for eating, no time for meetings, no time for getting to know each other, no time for creating, no time for mating, no time for life. Just things, and things, and outcomes and outcomes. Coffee breaks of sugar and carbohydrates, breakfast of sugar and carbohydrates, lack of fruit and vegetables on the meals. It didn’t matter our comments, it seemed that nothing was going to change. Again, I was always taking the experience as a perfect opportunity of consolidating my fasting habits, of learning and growing. They can take my food away, but they cannot steal my learning.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to work together in the creation of the first page of the newspaper. Again, I saw on you a creative wonderful soul. Someone that enjoyed herself doing what she wanted. I was a bit distant, focused on my text about patience, already taking the role of the lone individual that believes he is working for the community. And I was. For me it felt that it was way more important to mention the importance of patience and temperance rather than doing a collage of the first page of a newspaper, activity that I had already done in the school when I was 10, a product that was glued to the door of my wardrobe for at least one year.</p>
<p>I finished the text, felt satisfied about it, and got the group to do a brief standing meditation and share it with them. I was nervous. Irene interrupted the activity. I saw confused people, and loving ones. I focused on the enjoyment, and I couldn’t see the suffering. Once I finished, I received the hugs and loves of those that had enjoyed it, and I couldn’t realize those that had hate it. I was already envisioning me giving a speech every evening, creating material for the blog, while spreading a word of tolerance, well-being, and thrive around the participants of the project. We had the second reflection group where Elena opened herself a bit more, talking about the infinite amount of tension that she held inside and how she wouldn’t attempt to fight a decaying system. Her strategy would be to silently suffer whatever she had to suffer and then at the end give the due feedback. Coping mechanisms. It was the third day; the second meeting and people were already giving up. I was a fighter. I wasn’t willing to let anyone destroy my future, no matter how long or short it was. It didn’t matter that it was seven days, or seven hours. Giving up without fighting was not in my range of options. Ana Bella kept on justifying our feedbacks, on distancing herself from the decisions that the facilitators had taken, on suggesting us to have a good atmosphere, and applying her blind “let’s all be friends” attitude. I couldn’t stand it, I asked her to write and she argued that she didn’t want to alter our words, to modify our request, willings and desires. She was using writing as a counter argument for the biggest benefit of writing, which is the objectivity of the written words. I couldn’t believe it and I was freaking out. “Write your notes and give them to me” she kept on saying. “I want that Ana Bella takes notes in our meetings.” Here you have. System hacked. I remember you offered yourself as a secretary. It didn’t feel right to me, it wasn’t your job, but still it spoke wonders about your pacifying kindness. The next day they took action.
During the dinner, I had the opportunity to listen a potential far-right nationalistic voter expressing his fears and his extremely dangerous argumentations. Andrei had collaborated after a lot of effort to change the rooms and I felt a bit indebted to him. But, he had also that defeated attitude about the project and probably his own life. No matter the fight, no matter the struggle. Take things as they are and do your own. Post-communist syndrome, my colleague Filip had named it few months ago. I had jot down “Healthy level of disengagement” during the previous sessions, and I was starting to believe it. Andrei expressed his uncomforting feelings at noticing that he was alive in his own body, something completely alien to me, but that remind me of a university classmate’s comments during one of our first meditation sessions of the master: “I feel trapped inside my body.” I tried to force compassion, but it wasn’t coming. The conversation with Ana Bella and the passivity and vengeful attitude of Elena had left me in a quite quarrelsome state. I mentioned my views about how all human beings shared a common space for living called Planet Earth, and how if in a shared flat one of the tenants destroys the kitchen and kills the cat, the others consider taking measures. Andrei mentioned his inferiority feelings by recalling cases of moralizing vegans. “You feel superior, you believe that you do everything right. Let me do what I want. I am not forcing you to do what I want.” I have heard so many times that cheap and empty argument that I am seriously committed to write a proper text about how to argue with non-conscious selfish behavior. Andrei kept on saying that the Planet wasn’t a shared resource, that each of us would come back to our countries and that the best we could do was having a peaceful time there until the project finished. He mentioned that he would only fight if someone was attacking his personal resources, his territory, his nation. I saw his hand trembling while he bit the apple. I saw his eyes fixed on me, filled with terror, filled with tension and anger. He confessed that all that mediation and yoga wasn’t for him, that for him was a torture to be there standing up, breathing, and that he would rather be outside smoking another cigarette, thinking about football. I couldn’t believe it. Our worlds and mind were so distant from each other that it was going to require all my ingenuity to come up with a common point. I end up asking whether he believed that breathing for few minutes in a room while listening to someone speaking was reducing his well-being more than smoking a cigarette. He agreed. We shook hands and I left.</p>
<p>I found you outside and you saved me. I keep on thinking that you were in the right places at the right moments. I keep on thinking that this whole thing of the project was just a life lesson that was perfectly orchestrated for me to grow. I keep on having this Truman’s Show feelings that you were all actors saying what you had to say at the right moment. I keep on going nuts.</p>
<p>We talked and I could share with you the huge burden that the conversation with Andrei had left on me. I could share with you my surprise and realization at the fact that there were people that considered that talking about fruits was a personal attack, that inhabiting their body was uncomfortable, I shared with you what I have seen on Elena, all that tension and suffering that started to somatize on her skin. You listened to me, you reinforced me, you gave me feedback about the text, you made me talk softer, you shared your views that were so similar to mines, you supported me, you improved me, you loved me. Maybe, I was getting so familiar to your love that I was starting to take it for granted. I also told you that if in the following year you thought about finishing your life, you could always contacted me.</p>
<p>Another cultural night on the evening. I didn’t care, because I was there as “another talking ape on Planet Earth”, not as a nationalistic citizen. We had some laughs, we ate, we chilled, we drunk. The party developed and I thought about working for the news of the next day. I asked you while you were writing, and you accepted to help me. We worked together for a bit, but then decided to dance and enjoy. That evening had been the one you had gone dancing naked on the flowers. People was already applying their coping mechanisms and I kept on fighting. We danced, we kissed, and then you asked me to sleep together. Of course, I wanted to sleep with you. Of course, I wanted to share my bed and my intimacy with you. You had mentioned already about your period, and I wasn’t going to force you to have sex. But the idea of sleeping together sounded wonderful for me. You seemed like the best relationship I could have had: intellectually interesting, emotionally supportive, funny, spontaneous and crazy, physically beautiful, and with a healthy sexual libido.</p>
<p>We asked for permission to my roommates, but none of them could complain since it was my room. They all loved me for my intervention, they all liked me for the effort I was putting in the project and for how I was trying to make everything work and everyone happy. They valued me. I felt I was a good caring leader. A leader that had had the luck of finding a wonderful person to lead with, you. We slept for a while until you wake me up with your desires. I satisfied some of them and discover that you were also atypical on the bed. You scratched my back, I entered you body with my fingers and tongue, you welcomed my masculinity with your throat. We listened to the disturbed sleep of my roommates. You bit me, I bit you. I should have come at some point, but I didn’t want to. About an hour of intense shared passion gone by and we fell asleep together again. I loved you. You loved me. We love each other. I was yours; you were mine. We were together on that.</p>
