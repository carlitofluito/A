Carlos Alcala a.k.a. Carlito Fluito 2020-05-03 Prelude Sunday, 27 of October of 2019 Fotografiska Restaurant, Telliskivi Loomelinnak, Tallinn, Estonia 14.35 Such a trip, brother. Such a trip. So many things have happened that it is difficult to know where to start… Such a cliché, isn’t it? I am more connected to my friends now, more connected to myself, more connected to the world, more connected to the universe, more connected to life. I used to feel lonely, questioning what I was doing and towards where I was going. I used to feel purposeless, I used to be in dark places, living dark lives. I have seen a life now that I want to follow. I have seen a place that fills me with life and good energy. I am in a mood that resonates with who I am. I was in contact with my shadow yesterday. I was ready to witness and participate in death, in violence, in killing, in pain, in suffering, in committing horrendous deeds. I was ready for it. Now, I am ready for something else. "],

Preamble We found each other. We said goodbye. I thank the universe for all that happened in between. Hello A. 2019-08-06 - 04.15 Hello A., Don’t expect the best letter. It is 4 am. I went to sleep early, woke up a couple of hours ago and spend all this time ordering papers and stuff from the exchange. Some of the things I will write here probably will sound repetitive for both of us, you and me, because we separated last night. However, for our future selves can be a great memory trigger. I probably switch to cheesiness from time to time and tell you the wonderful human being that you are. Lucky me that I won’t see your rolling eyes, facial expressions, harsh comments, and your favorite word for the Carlos you met in the project: “Distance”. I am also procrastinating. I am not sure which of the hundreds of things I have to do should be first. Since I want to start doing something productive, I think it is a good moment for your letter. 09.12 Eventually, I meditated and then fall asleep. Now, I am in the train, going to the office to work as much as possible before Friday, when I have a meeting with my advisor. The procrastination of your letter is, as so many negative things, rooted on fear. The fear of leaving out things that I would like to remember, that I would like to immortalize. But in case of not writing anything, none of them will be saved, so, let’s try. I don’t know where to start. Maybe some of the most important words for me of this exchange are transformation, silence, compassion, surrender, secure attachment, relationship, trust… Many possibilities. Since this is a letter, I will write mostly about me, how I felt, thought and believed at different points, in a subjective way, and as much as I feel comfortable with. So, expect those parts that you don’t like from me: the “talking too much”, and the “selfishness” focus on my current and previous selves. 1.1 Promising beginnings (DAY 1 – 2019-07-26) I was in the toilet of the fast-food restaurant cleaning my nose. I had just met E., Ab., Cs., and L.. They were fine, they were okay. The type of participants I may expect in an Erasmus exchange: not super extrovert, and more on the passive side of the spectrum. Quite normal people. Actually, it is me the weird one that is super energetic (hyper-active), that comes up with socializing games and conversation topics from the first moment. However, when I went out of the restaurant and I saw you, obviously, the first thing the horny asshole thought about was: “Wow, some cute blondies.” My joy was increased a bit more by the fact that one of them seemed as crazy, spontaneous, and funny as me. We said “hi”, and to have an excuse for showing off my body skills and help my unfocused memory to remember your names, I proposed playing “reaction time” using your names. Ma. wasn’t much in the mood of playing, K. was adjusting to the situation, but you were already full mode. I liked you. We could talk and understand each other, at least at this playful level. M. and I. arrived, but didn’t play. Few minutes later, we realized that everyone was on the door of the association. We joined them. We went for a sandwich and I almost influence you enough to go vegetarian the rest of the week. You chose chicken. I didn’t blame you. Now, I am thinking about how I tried to save all those sandwiches that for sure they are moldy and decomposing right now somewhere in France. I didn’t want to blame you for your choices. The same with the cigarettes. I didn’t want to be annoying from the very beginning. Even less with the person that seemed I was matching the most. I did a couple of jokes here and there with the other participants. But I still had you on my mind. I was lucky enough to find you seated alone on the bus, smiling, almost like waiting for me. It was an easy decision to sit next to you. We talked about basics and not so basics. Well, it was me the one that talked the most. I told you some of my anecdotes, some of the official and unofficial things that I was doing with my life. I told you that my social energy could switch easily from praised to unacceptable. I became vulnerable to you, showing who I was. But it felt really good, really nice. I had been working on my fear of rejection during the previous months, and by then was already neutralized. Also, I had been working on my honesty and genuineness. I had been learning that truth beats lies. I had experienced that playing was a short-term strategy with ambiguous results. However, years of meeting people and observing the results of the interactions had told me what to say and what not to say. So, I avoided certain topics, and facilitate others. You also talked about yourself, you told me about your artistic interest and success. You told me about your emotions and goals. I was a bit surprised everything was going so smooth, so easy, so spontaneous and genuine. At some point, Sonia mentioned the possibility of me moving to the other house which would have changed my whole experience. I changed my future, and later on because of the guilt of my selfish choice, I changed the future of many others. We continued talking. You just liked to listen to me, I just liked to talk. We were the perfect couple. For some moment, I even thought about coming up with a excuse for kissing you in the bus, but I preferred to be patient. “We may see tonight, or tomorrow, I don’t know, but it has been a pleasure to meet you”. I entered the hostel for the first time. Check the basics: the floor, where to stretch, where to train… Finding the room took me a while, and it served as an excuse to explore the venue. I was already thinking about where’s and when’s. I asked around like a stupid whether I could wash my clothes in a washing machine. People took me as a weird disorganized guy, which I partly was. I fooled around for a bit and then, the universe, life, destiny, (maybe you?) gave me the perfect opportunity. You were alone, under a tree, in the darkness. You were probably not waiting for me, but I have learnt that opportunities must be taken. I came to you, feeling a bit nervous, excited because of the fantastic chance that I had been given. Parts of my mind were telling me those “what if’s” that often mess up my behavior, thoughts and emotions. “What if I fucked up now”. But you asked me about hugging trees, I asked you about massage, then I asked you about kissing you, and you turned your face around, said “Oohh!” with that cute intonation, and offered me your lips. I took them. “Nice way of starting a project”, you said I felt much more secure. I didn’t have the boastfulness and macho attitude that I could have had on the past by kissing a girl the first night, the first hours of a project. I was feeling more peaceful, more natural. More like if it was the appropriate and normal things to do in a relationship that was evolving faster than normal, but with a sound and solid tempo. We had meet each other, talked to each other, showed that we liked each other, and a manifestation of affection and sexual attraction was the following step. I just did it. The day before leaving, you told me that it was too fast to kiss on the first night. I answered you that if I wouldn’t have done it, you may have changed your mind about me, you may have discovered that my intensity was too big, or that you liked more someone else. Those were my fears, and those have been the lessons of years, that have told me that kissing early is better than not kissing at all. I felt much more secure after our mouths encountered each other, still with the realization on mind that a kiss was just a kiss and that you might found whoever else at any other moment of the project. As in life, nothing is safe, nothing is sure, and nothing is for granted. But I felt good, I feel safe, I felt secure. I washed my clothes while you were drinking and then we spend the night talking and laughing with T., H., O., E., and maybe a few others. I saw you talking with Hum. for a couple of times, thinking that he might match physically more with you more than me. But I left those thoughts aside. I listened for the first time one of your weirdness that might spark rejection on normal people: your affinity to cockroaches. On my head, I had some surprised thoughts about your strange uniqueness, that made me undersatnd a bit more the marks that your “cat” had left on your forearms. But who was I to consider weird another person, when we are all weird, and I was probably one of the weirdest there? I loved myself. You looked like you loved yourself. I thought that it didn’t matter much whether you liked cockroaches, or moutons if we were going to be together only for ten days. During the night, I took a couple of tiny opportunities to kiss you before separating and going to sleep. I was happy, I was excited. I had had an incredibly funny night listening to T.’s and H.’s jokes. Avoiding a direct confrontation with the negative attitude of H. and having kissed the girl that I liked the most, the one I had connected so genuinely with. I took my duvet, spread it on the floor, lied down, put my meditation on my earbuds, send some love to the planet and fall sleep. 1.2 Changing lives (DAY 2 – 2019-07-27) I woke up excited, ready to kick that project out. Perfect timing for fasting, doing some exercise, stretching a little bit and start the day with positive energy. I am not sure if you were also there, in the middle of everything, stretching and enjoying your body in front of everyone. We played that endless names’ game, and the dynamics of the group started to transform. I was already training myself, not letting my life be wasted by bad organization. People asked me why I was barefoot, and I answered why not. I walked over the stones to make the soles of my feet harder, but it was nothing considering what was going to come. We played to meet each other, but you and I had already some advantage on each other. Seeing your tie was too easy for me, and still, we were in front of each other. We looked into each other eyes, and I thought about remaining there the rest of the time, getting to know each other to a new deeper level, a level without words, a world of gazes and souls. Your eyes were beautiful, and I was hoping you were thinking my eyes were too. I was smiling, because feeling happy needs to be shared. I felt uplifted by your beauty, and the idea that we have already connect and kissed the previous night. The activities about fake news started. Too much talking, too much theory, too many concepts. A lot of blah, blah. Fears, expectations and contributions. I tried not to put almost any fear and expectation. I knew what these projects are usually about, and it is always on me the responsibility of growth and learning. Whatever the situation, whatever the people, whatever the content, I am the one that has to growth, and I am the one that must do whatever he can to get the best from the situation. I couldn’t let the outcome of my life to be dependent on external circumstances. I didn’t know anything about surrender, and surrender was the lesson that saved me the most. The day went by, I saw the annoyance of some, the confusion of many, the interest of a few, and the boredom of the rest. I was especially curious about H., who seemed to be suffering the most with the whole thing. I have to admit that I raised my hand to participate in the social committee because you had raised it before. My first impulse was not to overload my time in these projects with extra tasks, but I liked you, and I thought that spending time together would benefit me and make me learn and enjoy more the experience. Also, the other people that had raised their hand, Ir. and M., seemed like intelligent people to work with. Food, more activities and our first social committee meeting where we clearly showed that we were better at organizing ourselves than the facilitators. With just a meeting, we were already making the exchange ours: veneration envelopes, ideas for rules, organization for the shopping, boxes for public communication. We were doing what the organizers hadn’t thought about. On the evening, we had our first reflection group, when H. left pretty offended and angered. A. B. mentioned her highly sensitive reactions to those types of situation, and then played some Pollyanna optimism by saying that we had to focus on the good things. I didn’t see the situation as “us against them”, but it was clear that things could be done way better. The meeting finished and I went out looking for H.. I found her on the car, and I suggested getting a ride together. H.’s car was a reflection of her life: messy, disorganized, careless, dirty. It was my first lesson about compassion. Previous night, I had been really close to openly confront her, but I had preferred to remain smiley observing her inner suffering and pain. However, when I entered the car and started cleaning and collecting dirt and bottles, I couldn’t feel other than pity for her. She was a lost soul with tons of pain and suffering inside. All her anger and annoyance were just a reflection of the huge turmoil that she carried everywhere she was. I remain silent until she started to open up, applying the second lesson of the exchange: silence. We were singing on the road, looking for an open store that we couldn’t find in a Saturday evening. She told me about her feelings, thoughts, and sensations. I advised her to be patient and compassionate. All of us were just trying to do our best. That is all. We came back. I felt uplifted for having helped the person that seemed to be suffering the most. I walked around the venue and you were there. We found each other. We went out to the grass, and we talked. I mentioned later how one of those courses that I had mentioned so many times (Mindvalley) was taught by a couple, (she into yoga, he into self-development) that had the routine/ritual of having a walk and speaking about their respective days, their inner worlds and their relationship every evening. We sort of did it. I cannot remember what exactly we talked that day. We probably shared our views about the project, some of our life experiences, my spiritual experiences, the direction that our relationship was taking, and how I had spent the day trying to find a place for G. in our room. After the dinner, while people were preparing the intercultural night, I got surprised at knowing that the two Romanian guys, An. and Io., and E. and O., had accepted to move. T. was also okay with the change. I would sleep on the floor as I wanted, and everybody would be happy. That was my second booster of the day. I had written on so many notebooks that the key of my happiness was making other people happy, that improving so many lives at once was like getting instantly high. I shared all that positivity with you, and you were there to received it with your silent attention, your lovely smile. I was so lucky to have met you, to had you as support for my craziness and spontaneity, to count with your acceptance. I was feeling so good, so secure, so at peace, thanks to your presence. The intercultural night started. I fooled around, eat some sugar, drink some wine. I danced and played for a bit, just to keep my body functional. Then, I went to the shower, letting people get drunk while I clarified my brain, body and soul. When I came back, I discover that H. was drunker than I expected. I avoided us getting alone and avoided her trying to kiss me. I had discovered that evening that she and T. were engaged, and I was, by no means, someone to meddle in their relationship. I already had you, and you were enough. I had observed other girls during the day, and yes, K., Mar., Cs., or even Ir. looked nice, but I was sure none of them were as interesting, intelligent and captivating as you. At some point, we had a walk around the park when you mentioned that you liked the way I was aware of your needs. I couldn’t realize at that moment how important was what you had said. H. continued her performance, getting drunk and disappearing. On the entrance, we had the idea of preparing the “Truth News, True Now”, which you help me to edit and correct. If I would have been high, I would have thought that it was just another genius idea sparked by the weed. But I wasn’t, and I got serious and conscientious about it. M., K., you and I end up talking on the gym about the system and the functioning of human beings and the planet. I wanted to spend the night with you, but I was feeling secure, and I didn’t want to make pressure. We had kissed a few times during the day, and each times our eyes met each other manifested desire and complicity. The talk was over. We kiss once more, said goodnight. I went to my floor with my new roommates. I fell asleep feeling fulfilled for an excellent day. 1.3 Feelings of accomplishment (DAY 3 – 2019-07-28) “Woman!” was the first thing I told you that morning. I woke up sleep deprived. Stressing out about the “Truth News”. Excited for having the possibility of sharing a message that I wanted to share and placating my blaming my tendencies of overworking and taking too much responsibility. In less than 40 minutes we were able to finish the script, communicating what we wanted to do to the social committee, soothing down M. T.’s stress, and convincing Mir. to give us the floor. We even envision a small performance where you were the assistant giving me water while I spoke. So meaningful, symbolic, and archetypical already. The man changing the world, and the woman behind supporting him and keeping him alive. I would have liked it to be more equal, to share the speech with you, but the rush and your agreement made us choose the most efficient outcome. People in general liked the performance, Mir. told us to repeat it every morning, which was the idea I had on mind. Unlucky me, I couldn’t predict that people would feel offended and attacked by me talking about fruits. Another lesson, Carlos, another lesson. The day went on. The facilitators mentioned that the journalist they had arranged to come wasn’t coming. A big fucked up for an organization, but I never liked to catch a big fish in a small bucket. Too easy for me. Participants had complained the day before. Facilitators had muted us. Then, they had revealed themselves. We argued a bit about terms like scoops, information and news. I didn’t want to become too quarrelsome, I wanted to keep it cool and control myself. There was no point on discussing about words. But few unfortunate comments and the huge misinterpretation that a video in French with automatic subtitles generated by YouTube set me a bit on fire. I managed to speak my voice a couple of times, making clear that different languages, cultures and backgrounds were the origin of many potential confusions. I also protected Google and the Internet, because, you know, planet Earth in 2019. (You had also mentioned the day before that the two things you felt most grateful in your life were the Internet and the European Union because, you know, human nature during your childhood). At some point along the morning, I discovered that H. was being expelled. I tried to wake her up a couple of times, to make her participate, to save her. She had mentioned the previous night that she believed on me, that she has seen authenticity on me, that I wasn’t a fake “happy type”, that I was something more real. I had found a believer, and believers are to be protected. But talking with So. and some other facilitators looked like the ultimate decision had been already taken. H. was leaving, and T. was leaving with her. It hurt. It hurt the fact that I couldn’t do anything to avoid it. It hurt the fact that our voice wasn’t listened. It hurt the unfairness of the situation. It hurt that they weren’t going to have an opportunity of saying goodbye to us. So. told me that they would say goodbye to those that they wanted. It hurt to let go two of the people I have realized I could connect most with. And still, they went. They left during an activity to avoid disturbing the group and creative bad vibes according to the organizers. That was extremely badly done, that was extremely unprofessional, of an extreme low quality. Organizers kept on reveling themselves. That was the way they were solving problems: kicking people out in second day. My lesson again was to surrender, to accept the situation, to stop fighting. I had fought so much the previous day arranging the rooms, confronting the disbelief and discouragement of many, that I felt that I shouldn’t keep on going with the strategy further. I felt that pressing too much wasn’t the best, at least that earlier. The situation was already tense, and So. had mentioned that the decision came from above. Et. and his old-school teaching attitude seemed inflexible to me as well. It was a lost battle. A battle that had been fought without me. A battle that I had missed. A battle where I hadn’t had the opportunity of intervening. H. left. T. left. I kept on learning my lessons: acceptance, compassion, surrender. I thought that H. would learn her lesson and that the next time she would be more loving, and less alcoholic. I learned my lesson, and I decided that my voice had to be listened more often. I wrote about patience; I shared it with you. Somehow you were there all the time, supporting me, listening to me, giving me feedback, improving myself and helping me grow. In the coffee break I had looked for you exclusively to apologize for having told you “Woman!” the first thing in the morning. You didn’t care for it, but for me it felt right to do it, since you were the human being, the person, the woman that was actually supporting and caring the most for what I was trying to do. Your presence, your water. The day continued. Same tempo, and same rushing attitude all the time. No time for eating, no time for meetings, no time for getting to know each other, no time for creating, no time for mating, no time for life. Just things, and things, and outcomes and outcomes. Coffee breaks of sugar and carbohydrates, breakfast of sugar and carbohydrates, lack of fruit and vegetables on the meals. It didn’t matter our comments, it seemed that nothing was going to change. Again, I was always taking the experience as a perfect opportunity of consolidating my fasting habits, of learning and growing. They can take my food away, but they cannot steal my learning. We were lucky enough to work together in the creation of the first page of the newspaper. Again, I saw on you a creative wonderful soul. Someone that enjoyed herself doing what she wanted. I was a bit distant, focused on my text about patience, already taking the role of the lone individual that believes he is working for the community. And I was. For me it felt that it was way more important to mention the importance of patience and temperance rather than doing a collage of the first page of a newspaper, activity that I had already done in the school when I was 10, a product that was glued to the door of my wardrobe for at least one year. I finished the text, felt satisfied about it, and got the group to do a brief standing meditation and share it with them. I was nervous. I. interrupted the activity. I saw confused people, and loving ones. I focused on the enjoyment, and I couldn’t see the suffering. Once I finished, I received the hugs and loves of those that had enjoyed it, and I couldn’t realize those that had hate it. I was already envisioning me giving a speech every evening, creating material for the blog, while spreading a word of tolerance, well-being, and thrive around the participants of the project. We had the second reflection group where El. opened herself a bit more, talking about the infinite amount of tension that she held inside and how she wouldn’t attempt to fight a decaying system. Her strategy would be to silently suffer whatever she had to suffer and then at the end give the due feedback. Coping mechanisms. It was the third day; the second meeting and people were already giving up. I was a fighter. I wasn’t willing to let anyone destroy my future, no matter how long or short it was. It didn’t matter that it was seven days, or seven hours. Giving up without fighting was not in my range of options. A. B. kept on justifying our feedbacks, on distancing herself from the decisions that the facilitators had taken, on suggesting us to have a good atmosphere, and applying her blind “let’s all be friends” attitude. I couldn’t stand it, I asked her to write and she argued that she didn’t want to alter our words, to modify our request, willings and desires. She was using writing as a counter argument for the biggest benefit of writing, which is the objectivity of the written words. I couldn’t believe it and I was freaking out. “Write your notes and give them to me” she kept on saying. “I want that A. B. takes notes in our meetings.” Here you have. System hacked. I remember you offered yourself as a secretary. It didn’t feel right to me, it wasn’t your job, but still it spoke wonders about your pacifying kindness. The next day they took action. During the dinner, I had the opportunity to listen a potential far-right nationalistic voter expressing his fears and his extremely dangerous argumentations. And. had collaborated after a lot of effort to change the rooms and I felt a bit indebted to him. But, he had also that defeated attitude about the project and probably his own life. No matter the fight, no matter the struggle. Take things as they are and do your own. Post-communist syndrome, my colleague F. had named it few months ago. I had jot down “Healthy level of disengagement” during the previous sessions, and I was starting to believe it. And. expressed his uncomforting feelings at noticing that he was alive in his own body, something completely alien to me, but that remind me of a university classmate’s comments during one of our first meditation sessions of the master: “I feel trapped inside my body.” I tried to force compassion, but it wasn’t coming. The conversation with A. B. and the passivity and vengeful attitude of El. had left me in a quite quarrelsome state. I mentioned my views about how all human beings shared a common space for living called Planet Earth, and how if in a shared flat one of the tenants destroys the kitchen and kills the cat, the others consider taking measures. And. mentioned his inferiority feelings by recalling cases of moralizing vegans. “You feel superior, you believe that you do everything right. Let me do what I want. I am not forcing you to do what I want.” I have heard so many times that cheap and empty argument that I am seriously committed to write a proper text about how to argue with non-conscious selfish behavior. And. kept on saying that the Planet wasn’t a shared resource, that each of us would come back to our countries and that the best we could do was having a peaceful time there until the project finished. He mentioned that he would only fight if someone was attacking his personal resources, his territory, his nation. I saw his hand trembling while he bit the apple. I saw his eyes fixed on me, filled with terror, filled with tension and anger. He confessed that all that mediation and yoga wasn’t for him, that for him was a torture to be there standing up, breathing, and that he would rather be outside smoking another cigarette, thinking about football. I couldn’t believe it. Our worlds and mind were so distant from each other that it was going to require all my ingenuity to come up with a common point. I end up asking whether he believed that breathing for few minutes in a room while listening to someone speaking was reducing his well-being more than smoking a cigarette. He agreed. We shook hands and I left. I found you outside and you saved me. I keep on thinking that you were in the right places at the right moments. I keep on thinking that this whole thing of the project was just a life lesson that was perfectly orchestrated for me to grow. I keep on having this Truman’s Show feelings that you were all actors saying what you had to say at the right moment. I keep on going nuts. We talked and I could share with you the huge burden that the conversation with And. had left on me. I could share with you my surprise and realization at the fact that there were people that considered that talking about fruits was a personal attack, that inhabiting their body was uncomfortable, I shared with you what I have seen on El., all that tension and suffering that started to somatize on her skin. You listened to me, you reinforced me, you gave me feedback about the text, you made me talk softer, you shared your views that were so similar to mines, you supported me, you improved me, you loved me. Maybe, I was getting so familiar to your love that I was starting to take it for granted. I also told you that if in the following year you thought about finishing your life, you could always contacted me. Another cultural night on the evening. I didn’t care, because I was there as “another talking ape on Planet Earth”, not as a nationalistic citizen. We had some laughs, we ate, we chilled, we drunk. The party developed and I thought about working for the news of the next day. I asked you while you were writing, and you accepted to help me. We worked together for a bit, but then decided to dance and enjoy. That evening had been the one you had gone dancing naked on the flowers. People was already applying their coping mechanisms and I kept on fighting. We danced, we kissed, and then you asked me to sleep together. Of course, I wanted to sleep with you. Of course, I wanted to share my bed and my intimacy with you. You had mentioned already about your period, and I wasn’t going to force you to have sex. But the idea of sleeping together sounded wonderful for me. You seemed like the best relationship I could have had: intellectually interesting, emotionally supportive, funny, spontaneous and crazy, physically beautiful, and with a healthy sexual libido. We asked for permission to my roommates, but none of them could complain since it was my room. They all loved me for my intervention, they all liked me for the effort I was putting in the project and for how I was trying to make everything work and everyone happy. They valued me. I felt I was a good caring leader. A leader that had had the luck of finding a wonderful person to lead with, you. We slept for a while until you wake me up with your desires. I satisfied some of them and discover that you were also atypical on the bed. You scratched my back, I entered you body with my fingers and tongue, you welcomed my masculinity with your throat. We listened to the disturbed sleep of my roommates. You bit me, I bit you. I should have come at some point, but I didn’t want to. About an hour of intense shared passion gone by and we fell asleep together again. I loved you. You loved me. We love each other. I was yours; you were mine. We were together on that. 1.4 Censored for democracy (DAY 4 – 2019-07-29) Obviously, there is no good tale without a change of direction in about the middle of it. Here is where we are. It all started in the morning, I woke up, you woke up. You left, and I went down, getting ready to spread the “Truth News” of the day. But it was already too late. The fear was winning. Mir. found me and told me that the activity that she has praised the previous day was better not to be repeated again because some people have complained to her and disagreed with what I was saying. I couldn’t believe it. I soon realized that talk about fruits and drinking water was making some participants more uncomfortable than what I could have predicted. It was difficult for me to accept that there was a majority of people that disagreed with what I was saying. Mir. referred to them as “many participants”, or “many complaints”, or “a lot of people” and those were vague and inaccurate terms that I wasn’t going to believe so easily. Besides, she kept on pressing me to focus on their activities about Fake News and use my inexistent free time to try to gather the group and ask their opinion in what I was proposing. I assumed that she was making it really difficult for me to try to make an impact on the program. The day moved forward and that French guy appeared with his toolkit, his videos and his stuff. I was already pretty distant of the whole thing. I didn’t care about the content, I cared about the people. I focused on my text for the evening and make a couple of interesting questions during the session just so no one could complain about my participation or the lack of it on the project. I was getting distant in any case. We did some more activities, but I was still piss by the morning censorship. At some point I had the idea of the ballots. I wanted to first-hand fact-check Mir.’s words about the general rejection of my morning news and my “Awakening Scoops”. I played St. Thomas and I told to myself that seeing was believing. I made the ballots, spread them, and at some point, got censored again by Mir.. She took me by the arm and drag me outside to ask me what I was doing. “I am defending democracy. I am giving them voice, so they can tell me individually if they like or not what I say and what I do.” “You want to confront people face to face, but many people don’t want that” “Have you seen the world?” I asked, “Why do you think there are many far right-wing movements increasing all around the world? It is because people can only vote once every four years. Ask the population more often and adjust to their needs, adjust to what they want and then you will avoid a really dangerous outcome.” “But what do you want? I don’t want that the journalist come and then people show their red cards.” She was really afraid. “I am just giving them the most efficient non-violent and non-intrusive way of giving me automatic feedback that I can think of. It is just for me, although I would love that we would use it for many decisions.” I repeated that sentence a couple of times along the conversation, but she didn’t quite get it. I was speaking in my clear and wordy tone, just being cautious about my words, trying not to sound violent, and letting my point clear. I had to repeat several times that what I was trying to do was giving them voices independently. But I assume they thought that I was organizing an uprising. In the organization, no one trusted me. But the participants vote green for the usage of the cards. I could have played more demagogic, and pushed the situation further, explaining them that we could get back the control of the exchange if we all moved in the right direction, but hopelessness, the topic I couldn’t talk in the news, won again on their hearts when the quick free time was over and we were trapped in another annoying and boring activity. K. was smarter, for her the day was great. She went to the mountain. For me, a continuous repression. In the reflection group, Et. took the role of A. B., first victim. It was obvious that they were trying, that they were making changes and that they were listening to what we were saying. But on the other hand, they didn’t trust on us. They were building the perfect “us vs. them” situation, even while implementing our feedback with 3 days of delay. Et. was a perfect scribe, and he took notes of our wishes and comments. Just to show him that we weren’t against, we all thank him his efficiency. On the evening, there was that organization fair. Before it started, M. T. let me read the text. I didn’t count with the support of any of the member of the organization, I merely didn’t have their censorship avoiding me doing it. I wasn’t alone because I had you and few others listening to my words, but I felt that I wouldn’t be able to do that for long. I read the political text that you had correct me. I also worked a bit on my voice and the way of communication. I read the text offering people to leave the room when they wanted. Many left, some stayed, and some of those that stayed were distracted. Thank them anyway for the effort. Later on, maybe the next day, you mentioned that you wouldn’t spend your free time listening to me. That also touched me. I went outside and meditated. I felt it coming when I visualized the future. I felt it running through my right arm, life was filled of wonderful things waiting for me. The fair started, a fair that I couldn’t care less about. We had talked about the possibility of expanding our relationship and how much you liked other participants. I was all-in to have my personal side-project that would end up in a collective manifestation of hedonism and love. But I rushed too much. I should have notice that not everyone was as open minded as I was, that not everyone was as familiar with physical contact as I was, and that not everyone can differentiate love from sex, and sex from love. I promoted and invited you to go ahead with the idea of including people in our sexual encounters as a proof of my trust on you, of my fidelity, of my personal secure approach at our relationship. Maybe, you took it as a lack of engagement, as a lack of interest towards you as a person. Who knows? Looking at the case with perspective, now is clear to me how I should have proceeded. Anyways, I worked out with O., and then we danced a bit guided by you. I interrupted you, rushed, and made them leave. Somehow, the other participants had prepared everything for us outside, putting the tatami and the blankets there. We went there to chill. I caress and touch Karolina out of caring and not exclusively out of sexual lust. We are all suffering souls in this planet. You were doing your thing with O. and G., and I felt secure by being there next to you, supporting you with my silent presence. G. was a bit too invasive with me, but I was letting him do, just to keep the vibe cool, relax and growing. Most of the people left, I arranged pretty much all the stuff that was outside because I had the energy to do it, and a good leader takes care of their group. G. played “last dick standing” and we end up kissing among the three of us. Kissing a boy is not the thing that I like the most, but I don’t mind if the cause was going to be bigger. I assume that that was also a mistake. The sky was beautiful, but the night was over. We said goodbye and we went to our different rooms. I was strange. I wasn’t sure about the direction that everything had taken in only one day. I had tried to give voice to the people but seemed to me that the people had already found their respective voices in their smartphones, drawings, and different forms of entertainment. You, my main supporter, had mentioned that the text I had written wasn’t that good. I had rushed the creation of a connection among the participants, making maybe a retrogression. I was confused. Anyways, it seemed that we had advanced at including G. in the game. I had the feeling that we could do great things if we collaborated properly. But did we? 1.5 Belgians in Strasbourg (DAY 5 – 2019-07-30) “Flip Flops! Or Flop Flops!” I am surprised about how morning stupidities can be so influencing. I was really sleep deprived and this thought came up to my mind at questioning myself if I wanted to wear the flipflops or the flop flops to Strasbourg. The sneakers might become too hot for the day, and I had the intuition that I would spend most of the time barefoot, as I had done all over the week, and as it was my plan for the rest of the days. I chose the flipflops. I went to the bus and I found you there, with an empty spot for me. I sat next to you, talked for a while, and then lied over your legs and played with your vagina. It was very reassuring to think that we were still together on that. For me, signs of affections were the confirmation of my hypotheses and a pacifier for my fears. You liked me, and I liked you. We arrived at the office where we had our departure five days ago. You kept on thinking about O., and I wasn’t paying much attention to that. I had told you that you could do as you pleased. I still felt secure with you. However, it wasn’t my favorite topic of conversation. In the office, the authoritarian boss of the organization and the journalist leaded the conversation, one of the best of the exchange. However, I quickly was silenced and got bored by the already mentioned topics. I had an idea that I considered worthwhile talking about, but I could only express it at the end, and I didn’t find a clear answer on it. Well, time for training then. I warm up my legs, work out my body, and observed how your levels of energy were constantly decreasing. I didn’t want to invade your life, and I let you be free. We went to the park, did an evaluation that for me felt meaningful, but for many people pointless. I kept training with my feet and legs with the sticks of the park and participating on the activity from time to time. The boss asked me whether I had managed other exchanges before and offered me to work together. Unlike the other facilitators, in half morning, he was intelligent enough to detect potential and put it on his favor, not against him. However, I didn’t have a very good intuition about that person, and I didn’t show a lot of enthusiasm when he mentioned it. We came back to the office, I played football, and then chilled on the floor, just to be kicked out by Son.. I couldn’t care less. I got annoyed by the 50€ but considering the money in my bank account, the lessons I was learning with my presence there were already paying off. We went to the Lebanese restaurant. We were all tired, but my tiredness was justified on the lack of food due to the fasting. Thus, after I ate, I recovered much of it. I was amused at seeing you eating on a restaurant after having been together sharing our food with our hands on the grass and knowing how little you could follow social standards. On the other hand, I was trying to not to think about Ma.’s behavior. She is Belgian, and that can explain many things. (I have a pretty strong prejudice about Belgians as selfish people). She has complained about the money of the transportation and the participation fee for about 30 minutes on the hall. She had been bugging M. and G. with her mistake, which I found especially unfair considering that the Croatians had had to pay more because of their association not because of any type of personal choice concerning luxury of transporation. I had also come from Brussels and I had only spent 35€. It was difficult for me to imagine someone expending almost 200€ only on the one-way tickets from Belgium to France. I am not sure how or why, but the organization covered the expenses of Ma.’s mistake, and after 30 minutes of complains that everyone had to hear and no negative consequence to her finances, she decided to reward herself and her great performance with a proper dish on the restaurant, social convention that I also profoundly disagree with. Anyway, I tried not to care. You were there, K. was there, Mar. was there, and I was tired. I thought that it was probably something personal. I have grown tired of listening to people complaining about capitalism without doing anything about it. I have grown tired of admiring people incongruences and then trying to moralize with intellectual ideologies that take individual sacrifices to be performed. I have been writing the whole day this text, and right now I was eating some boiled potatoes with vinegar and salt in a plastic recipient of a soup that I took from the trash the evening before leaving towards France. And still, I support a form of capitalism that distributes the wealth evenly and behaves more consciously with the natural resources. In the past, I consumed lots of information and complain for many years about the problems of our society, but I have discovered that I sleep better when my actions are congruent with my moral ideas, and when I am actively participating in changing the system. Hypocrisy is a bit of a harsh word, but not the most inaccurate one in certain situations. Capitalism stands for personal responsibility and the fact that each individual can make the best of the conditions where we are born. I have lived in Belgium 3 years of my life, and it is a bit of a pain to keep on seeing people that had never struggled accepting and being submissive to a system that devours the world. As we experienced with the chairs game, we in Europe are incredibly fortunate for having what we have. We are the richest of the planet, and specifically Belgium is a pretty wealthy country. The worst consequences of the climate change are starting to be paid by the poorest countries. While Belgium becomes the next Spain, in Chad, the drought keeps on killing thousands, and the typhoons of southeast Asia left millions homeless. Ma. could complain about her mistake buying the train tickets, annoy the Croatians with her pointless miseries, and then be rewarded and saved by an external organization; but buying a nice dish to celebrate it was a bit over the top for me. I learned silence; I learn non-contentiousness. I had you seated next to me with your little salad, and I couldn’t do other thing than offered you all my food. Ma. said that it was disgusting the fact that I sometimes eat directly from a can of beans when I am working on my office. Well, life is also built out of effort and sacrifices, not just nice restaurants and mistakes amended by the system people love to complain about. After the food, I had energy again. I kept on training and pushing the limits of my body a bit further. Climbing the pillars and jumping like a puma. At some point you asked me what my chargers were, and I behaved transactional, and asked you about money. Obviously, it was a joke, and if you would have reminded me for half a second the number of things you were doing for me, I would have written a list on the spot for you. But you moved away, offended. I kept on training. In case you still want to know, these are some of my chargers: Love, water, food, air, meditation, movement, stretching, people, understanding, nature, writing, reading, learning… I was still a bit affected by the idea of you liking O. and your reiterative comments. It was my mind reminding me about my insecurities and my avoidant attachment. I put it off with more movement, more challenges, and sending you some compassion when I looked at how tired you were. I would have loved to spend the evening together if you would have asked me so. But you had started to manifest or letting me know that you needed some personal space from time to time. Anyways, the activity around the city started. I was in the group with R. and Li., which were great positive and good energies for me. On the other hand, Et., another Belgian, was the leader and he was clearly annoyed by my attempts of democratizing the situation taking part of their power away. He was also scared of not being able to control me, not only by my endless levels of energy, but by my lack of respect to the authority and rules. M. got surprised that I could shower on a handbasin on the toilet, which for me was the most obvious thing to do. I kept on jumping and moving and then the event of the tram happened. I was playing to say goodbye when Et. realized that he was far away from controlling me. He played violence. I played silent pride and cold revenge. He threatened me with expelling me from the exchange. M. T. supported him whatever they said later. I swallowed my pride, my words, my being. I looked into his eyes asking him to relax while he was shouting at me, holding me by the arm. I asked people to remember the moment he invaded me physically, just so we were all in the same page if the situation evolved. I played it as cool as I could. I took my calendar and save a reminder for the 5th of August that stated my intentions of giving an extreme negative feedback with an explanation of what had just happened. Emotions come and go. As a psychologist I am very aware of that. But the consequences of an action should be maintained until the person has learned their lesson. I put my shawl over my head. I couldn’t do it in the Vipassana when I was feeling hopeless, lonely and depressed but that bunch of authoritarian fearful guys wouldn’t take me away the pleasure of withdrawing from life for a while. I listened to 10 minutes of binaural beats, focusing on my breath and letting the emotions develop and fade away. Mar. kept on interrupting me, because her discomfort at watching at me was more important than my feelings. I asked several times to leave me alone, but she couldn’t. Maybe she was trying to care for me, maybe she was just pacifying her inner turmoil at seeing me in such a strange and distressed way. After the 10 minutes, the record of Carlos and me in the forests of Belgium started to sound on my ears. I couldn’t help myself from smiling, laughing, loving, and glowing from inside. I felt so connected to Carlos, so supported by him, by his thoughts, by his ideas, by the love he randomly sends me from time to time. Carlos is a great human being, and I am incredibly lucky of having him on my life. And he was there in the tram, saving me from my thoughts, from my feelings, taking me away from that negative situation where I was trapped. I loved him so, so much, and I enjoyed so, so much, that it even felt better the realization that I was probably the person feeling the best of the whole tram after such a negative encounter. (Don’t get me wrong “such a negative encounter” means nothing compared to what you have gone through on your life, or to what so many others have and are suffering at this moment on the planet. It is just how the story is being written…). We went down the tram and it started raining. People protected themselves from the water falling from the sky, and I let it wet my cheeks. Lat. and others got closer and asked if everything was okay, if I should take care of my health because I could catch a cold. I thank them for caring and dismiss their advice. I shared some of my water with mint, and lemon that we have prepared on the restaurant. Another tram came and I laugh at R.’s plastic raincoat. Then, I teased R. and Li. explaining them how Indian people smoke weed in the name of Shiva. Eventually, I came back to my phone and wrote, to feel a bit more at peace, to feel more justice. I came up with this: I WILL NOT TALK IN YOUR PRESENCE If you touch me I’ll get back my space Listening transparent noise Wearing the burka in the tram Feeling the rain on my face Sharing my holy water Thanking not needed care Admiring Milano’s catwalks And smoking in the name of Bam Bam bole A priceless lesson for me May become an expensive one for you Forgive them father for they don’t know what they do. Remain silent in their presence for they attack your words. Then I prepared some lines in case I was asked to discuss what had happened: I’m using my right to refuse to talk with violent people. Until he apologizes and ask for forgiveness, I’ll will not utter a word to a violent person. If you’re interested in the content of my mind, I will do it outside of his presence. And I connected again with my warrior spirit. I don’t eat meat and I am always hungry. I don’t mind biting; my teeth are trained. And a witty paradox to lift up my intellectual mood. I wish I could be extremely intolerant with violence, but violent people don’t tolerate this type of extremism. I also had the luck of doing some express therapy with Mar. How often do you appreciate breathing? She surprised me a lot at her determined belief about me crying on the tram. I hadn’t cry. My eyes might had become red, as my face. Red of anger and unfairness. But I hadn’t cry. I wouldn’t mind admitting it, but it was simply inaccurate to say that I had. However, Mar. was a firm believer of the idea that I had cry and she seemed convinced on spread what she thought she had seen. I realized that miracles are not done by messiahs or prophets themselves, but by blind believers. Mar. seemed to change a bit from her first statement of “I hate everyone” to the one we agreed later of “I love everyone”. It felt superior to realized that I my mood had been transformed so quickly and that I was fully enjoying my walk. On the other hand, the selfishness attitude of Ma.’s wasn’t able to empathize with my mood or my emotional state at all. She even got annoyed by my lack of willingness of interacting and collaborating with the rest of the group. I took the chance to connect more with Mar., Cs., R. and Li.. I got sure to make it clear that I still was the guy with the loudest laugh, and the most positive attitude. They couldn’t silence me so easily. They couldn’t. My ego kept on growing and growing. We arrived at the city center and the group split. Old people on one side (R., Li., Lu., Et.), And. by its own, and young people on the other side (Ma., Mar., Cs.). I didn’t want to be alone. I wanted to be with young people, just to feel young. Ma. tried to escape from me in several occasions. She first started walking with the girls, then mentioned that there were not enough tram tickets for everyone, and finally accepted that I wasn’t going to give up so easily. I also did it to annoy her a little bit. My ego was having fun around. I turned to my phone and my social media. I send message to my friends all over the world, connect on the distance with them, send them love, remind them that I was alive, and I was thinking about them. The girls were shopping, and I was having fun by my own. I felt really powerful. I reminded myself of all the things that were going right on my life: my job, my house, my finances, my friends, my personal development, my creative endeavors, my internet presence. A few kids and some grown-ups with low emotional control weren’t going to shake my foundations. After few shops I got bored, I saw that other people were together somewhere else on the city, and I wanted to meet them. I went to the cathedral, but I arrived too early. I waited for them listening to the meditation. Send some love to the planet, gratitude to my being and the people of my life, and the rain took me out of the meditation in the right moment. Another of those synchronicities that I couldn’t explain you at the mountain. I saw the group of people that I was supposed to meet, but they hadn’t seen me. I stuck to them until my needs call me back. They were shopping, the rain was getting stronger and there was nothing to be done. I entered a bar, shitted, washed my face and mouth, and remembered that I wanted to buy condoms for everyone just to avoid any logistical limitations screw up a potential sex party. While I was running under the rain looking for an open pharmacy at 20.15, I had the feeling that I was again forcing the situation. The pharmacy was closed but there was a condom dispenser outside. I didn’t have cash. I went to the bank and they changed me a 10€ paper for coins. I think I spend about 12€ in condoms of different types and classes. Most of them are now in my bathroom, waiting for their occasion. It felt right to the extent that I wasn’t doing it for me. A good leader takes care of the members of their tribe. I was doing it for everyone. After my secret adventure, I caught the group back. I didn’t know where I was, where I had to go, when I had to be where, and how I was supposed to go. Logistics, you know. I ran barefoot under the rain, following the live location that Ah. has shared on WhatsApp. It felt like a spy in a James Bond movie. I found them, and then, let myself be taken to the restaurant. You were there. I didn’t feel like talking to anyone. I wanted to be understood, not asked and questioned about what had happened during the day. My ego was still pretty active, and you comment about O. touched me enough to not wanted to talk more with you. Besides, I was extremely tired. I hadn’t eaten almost anything during the day, just the nectarine that I had taken from the office before our lunch, and the durum falafel. I was on my limits. I tried to drink the tea, but you were talking Russian with K.. Anyway, it was a good excuse to let myself be taken away from reality. You asked me how my day had been, what my feelings were, and I told you: “I will answer in half an hour.” I played the hypnosis track under the turban. I let my body alone and dove deep inside the dark places of my mind where beliefs are stored. I clearly had said to K. to tell anyone not to interrupt me. I trusted on her. I felt betrayed with each interruption, but I achieved forgiveness. She was K.. I couldn’t get angry with her. I got interrupted several times: the waitress, V., O.. Enough was enough. I learned my lesson. K. wasn’t taking care of me, I had to do it myself. When I hit O.’s face, people understood a bit better that I was a sleeping beast, not a dead mouse. The hypnosis kicked pretty strongly. I got awaked with a huge self-confidence, renewed energy and the impetus of conquering the planet once more. “You are such a liar”, you said. “You are such a lion”, I understood. I walked away feeling even more reinforced. I didn’t want to talk with anyone, not even with you. But you had saved the food for me. I said “Thank you”. I wanted to be separated from the group. I wanted to feel different, to feel distant. I was expecting the social committee to appear with the meeting on the back of the bus as we had agreed the previous day. I went to the back of the bus. No one appeared. I reminded O. not to touch me if I didn’t want, being assertive and trying to avoid any connotations of violence. I couldn’t find you on the bus when I got in. I could have tried to sit with you and talk about your day, but fate place me alone. I tried to write, and I wrote. I tried to sleep, and I couldn’t. When we arrived, I tried again to talk with you. I told O. to find you, but you were gone. I recompose myself, and left the bus calmly, still tired, and with the pain of the photosensitivity on my eyes but feeling like a lion walking on the savanna. No predators, only preys. The driver on the bus couldn’t rush me. I looked into his eyes and I thank him the patience. I felt extremely powerful. You appeared out of nowhere. But it was too late. I wanted to talk with you before. I wanted to know your mind. Still, you had been the person taking care of me, the one that had asked for a container and collected the food. I had to say thank you. But it was a sing of boastfulness more than one of gratitude. It was a cold thank you, not a felt one. You got the message. I went inside and proved everyone that me and my body were still functioning no matter the conditions of our situations. Only with the nectarine, the durum, and a bite of an apple, after a day of walking and moving around the city, after the confrontation with Et. and M. T. , and after days of sleep deprivation, I did my workout routine. K. told me that looked like a broken computer. To me it looked like the ultimate proof of respect. It is funny how the same situation can be interpreted in such different ways for different people. I went to the shower, cleaned my clothes, wore my swimming pants and pullover, and went out to see what the people offered me. In. (UK) was there. In. was that person I hadn’t had the opportunity of talking enough with. I had just crossed a few words and listened to her comments on the sessions. It was clear that she wasn’t like the rest, that she was more mature, more intelligent, wiser, and probably also questioned her presence in that charade. I had offered her to participate with us in the social committee. She had politely rejected it twice, and I thought it was enough. However, that day on the hall she was there, willing to talk and mediate, genuinely curious to know about my version of the story. I shared it with them and the rest of you. I played my non-violent passive redundant, overly clear and precise way of communication, just so no one could tell me that I was being too direct or aggressive. I confronted Ma. a couple of times, as well as Mar. about their consumerist behavior. I willingly seek for help and advice from In., who told me things that I have already been told in the past, or that I was already aware of. Empathy, placing myself on the other person shoes, Socratic questions. I know them, but I rarely apply them. I thank In. for the effort. She talked about my social life in Belgium, and whether I had people to talk with. I confessed that the life of an expat sometimes gets difficult concerning fulfilling social relationships. Even more if you are the weird type I consider myself. I was going to start talking about how grateful and happy I felt for having met you and your undeniable role as pacifier and emotional supporter during the exchange when you stood up and left to the hall. It didn’t hurt, it was just bad timing. Deep inside I really wanted you to listen to me indirectly admitting that you were a key piece in the puzzle of my balance. I wanted you to know that I still loved you and that I valued you. But you stood up and left. I told it anyways. We talked a bit more and then went inside. I kept on praising In. for her social wisdom and made her consider that she the most important person of her life. I made her reflect on the way she talked to others and how she talked to herself. I couldn’t see it coming, but it seemed that those comments were a motivator for her to leave the next day. I was expelling another of my believers from the exchange. She had called me extraordinary, and then unconsciously and unwillingly I had facilitated her departure. Another asset left. We were becoming alone. It crossed my mind the idea of going to your room and lie with you. But Mar.’s mood and your need of distance made me avoid that option. I had the huge luck of having a deep conversation with In. (Portugal). My ego was still activated, and more than a compassionate and understanding psychologist, I was a pushing coach giving a wake-up call to a powerful dormant being. I showed In. my routines, my affirmations, my mindset, my warrior attitude, my respect towards my health, body, mind, and spirit. I was really tired after the day, the fasting and the workout. I was really sleep deprived and my brain couldn’t have rested. And still, my kindness forced me to stay awake and talk with In. while she shared her psychological struggles. I prioritized her well-being over mine. We talked for at least an hour about my pride, my ego, our relationships (you and me), her relationship with herself, with the project, with her family, and with her life. I helped as much as I could help her at that moment, and she recommended me that morning hugs are less invasive that night ones. I took the advice. We hugged. I was uplifted by the fact that she had opened up to me, that she had allowed herself to be touched and touch a man without any sexual implications, that she was a bit freer and more at peace. I was extremely tired. I went to my tatami on my room. Lied there and tried to sleep. But two meditation, and several binaural beats later my brain didn’t want to. It wasn’t only the somatization of the dermatitis in my hands; the whole experience was starting to infect my mind. I was suffering from insomnia, that type of negative insomnia that I was advising A. B. and B. about. The insomnia of an untamed mind in a stressful situation. 1.6 The devil at the mountain (DAY 6 – 2019-07-31) I woke up and did what I was supposed to do. I collected my courage, went to your room, and with my hurt beating as when I approached girls that I like on bars, I opened the door of your room and lied next to you. Mar. complained, but you didn’t reject me. You felt my chest raising up and down, you noticed my stress, my strong heartbeats. Yes, I was nervous, yes, I felt vulnerable. Yes, I didn’t know what your thoughts were after the episode of the previous day. But you hugged me and loved me. You reminded me about the distance, but you still came to me, looking for my body. Mar. came back with her suffering to destroy our encounter, once again. It is incredible how detrimental for our relationships all those interruptions have been. Maybe detrimental, maybe reinforcing, who knows. Things that are difficult are more valuable. So, we couldn’t connect in the morning as I would have liked it. At that point, I have already taken the decision of taking care of myself and my life. The stupid comment of Etienne about answering work emails during the exchange two days ago had made things clear: I could, and I was going to prioritize my life to that project. During your talk about Stonian language I started to feel anxious and trapped. What the fuck was I doing there? Doing nothing, fighting for what? To what results. Just to be blamed by people, just to keep on confronting them for my good willingness. It had nothing to see with you or K., I know you know. It was all inside me and had to go out. That is why I went out and meditated. I needed it so much. M. T. came, interrupted me, and after trying my best to not be violent and express my need of solitude, she kept on pushing me to participate in the activity. An activity that I didn’t give a fuck about it. The facilitators couldn’t see what was going on in front of their eyes. Thanks to my group I could keep on meditating and managing my state of mind. They let me the space I needed. They reminded me that I had to take care of myself. After the coffee break, I got to know that In. (UK) was leaving, and I went to her room for talking and saying goodbye. It was a wonderful conversation. She stated her mind, she mentioned all the things that we shared about the project, how she could have tried to stay if the project could have had any better quality, if the dynamics were better. But they weren’t. She also mentioned how my comment about self-love had influenced her enough to take the decision and choose for her life and herself. Souna supported her and mentioned that she was also willing to leave for similar reasons and that was very appropriate to use In. departure as an excuse. I was shocked. I was sad, I was defeated. People kept on leaving. People chose to leave. People chose to give up, to be defeated, to accept an unchangeable fate. All my warrior attitude, all my attempts, all my fighting wasn’t serving for anything. I had learned about the healthy level of disengagement, and I was applying it, but they were giving me an even better lesson, the detachment and surrender. I had realized that that was an “us or them” situation. Either we learned our lesson and got disengaged and detached from the project, showing hopelessness and perishing during the rest of the project; or they realized what was going on and changed the dynamic. I had already done my best. I couldn’t do anything else. Not anymore. I cried at In.’ room while confessing my need of fighting for my life, and for the life of others. Confessing my unwillingness to give up, to surrendered; confessing that no matter whether it was two days or two hours I would fight until the last second. Expressing my need and will of easing the life of others, of reducing their suffering and making the world a better place. Souna and In. saw me crying with compassion. I broke down in front of them. No matter how strong and alpha I had felt the previous night doing push ups after a day of fasting. There I was getting in touch with my personal defeat, assuming that the healthiest strategy was a withdrawal. I just wanted to make the world a better place, to help people to enjoy their lives more, to be happy making them happy. After I recover myself, I realized that In. and Sa. were being more intelligent and wiser than me. They were taking more care of themselves than what I was doing. I wasn’t practicing what I was preaching. In Spanish we say that “Una retirada a tiempo es una victoria” 1 I was starting to believe it. I told In. that I lived with the constant worry that the world could become hell. Although it seems that is evolving into a better place, that we are moving forwards, there are still many fears about humanity that make me lose my hopes from time to time: climate change, artificial intelligence, nationalism, selfishness, wealth inequality. Later on, In. gave me a book named The new silk roads about China’s commercial strategy to become the next world ruler. I told her that that book wasn’t helping my existential fears about the future of humankind. We laugh, I hugged them. I hugged them again. I didn’t want to leave that room. I didn’t want to find myself alone again in a place where I was realizing I didn’t belong. I detached from the room, from In., and from Sa.. They told me to rest, and they were deeply right. I tried to go down and follow the lecture about Erasmus plus of that woman, but I couldn’t. Sonia tried to talk with me, and I answered one of those sentences that I had prepared: Right now, I don’t feel like talking. Maybe later. I took the falafel that you have saved for me last night. I ate it on the gym and fell the drowsiness of the after-meal clogging my mind. It was a good moment for a siesta. I went to the room and tried to sleep. I put the binaural beats of 10 minutes. Once, twice, three times, four times. It wasn’t possible. I was deeply sleep deprived, but I wasn’t able to sleep. I was suffering from insomnia again. That exchange was getting into my psychological health. That was deeply unfair. That was a clear signal that I had to change my strategy. I went to the lunchroom. I wasn’t hungry, I was just fooling around people. Trying to find someone that could understand me. In. (Portugal) told me to look at the envelope, to read the messages. She saved me. I found your note, Maf.’s, In.’, the questions, the support. I had tears on my eyes, and I looked for you. I went down and I found you outside, taking the sun, enjoying yourself. I came to you, we talked. You were trying to smoke, I was just thinking on lying there, hugging each other and giving us love. I was extremely tired, extremely sensitive, and extremely receptive to words. You mentioned empathy, you mentioned compassion, you mentioned letting go, and you mentioned distance. You propose me to smoke and my dopamine kicked hard. You confessed that we could have rule the world together and that comment sparked my hopes and energies again. The lighters didn’t work, and I climbed looking for one. F. never knew that I saw her sleeping. I found G. in the door and took his lighter. I warned you about how spiritual and symbolic I become when I smoke, but you accepted it. My energy levels were really low, but the cannabis made me feel as if I was strong again. I smoked and you left me alone. I knew that you were going to come back, I had full faith on you. I stretched, connected with my body, with my muscles, my tendons and my bones. I re-connected with myself. There was a moment I looked into a window and found myself on the reflection. It was like a flashback of those years of teenagerhood when I struggled and suffered so much with the self-acceptance of my corporal image. It was a direct connection to those episodes where, while being high and drugged, I annihilate millions on neurons by looking at the mirror trying to understand who I was, and why what I was seeing was the container of my self. However, that afternoon, I didn’t want to go that deep, I wasn’t ready for that. I avoided the mirror, my insecurities, and that deeper and darker part of my unexplored existence. You arrived like a savior while I was stretching on the stairs, and we escape the prison together. I was so happy and excited about our re-encounter. It felt so good to have time just for the two of us, away from the project, away from the people, away from interruptions. We were going to the mountain, to the nature. There where we couldn’t have been yet. There where we should have been all the time. You said that you were feeling like walking a pet. For me, it was like releasing the beast. We kissed on the cemetery and it seemed that the passion increased. I stopped myself because of the social norms that have told me that having sex between a church and the remains of death people could make some people feel offended. I asked why humans venerate dead people instead of alive ones. Fortunately, I had been saved a bit ago by my own veneration envelope and those people that loved me. We moved to the nature. I was following you. We both were barefoot as it couldn’t be otherwise. But I wasn’t expecting it that we were going to go up the mountain, avoiding paths and without any type of shoes. I was really tired, but high, with my brain started to function at thousands of miles per hour, while my body demanded for immediate rest. But you kept on walking, on telling me to remain silent and distant, and pushing my intellectual and physical limits further and further. It all seemed like an initiatory journey, like the one of Dante going to the hell, or The Alchemist crossing the desert, or so many other tales, where the protagonist is led by a mysterious being that seems to have all the answers and know the main character even better than himself. I was high. You were there guiding the path, taking control over the situation. I was extenuated, suffering from my naked feet, from my failing muscles, while you seemed full of energy, walking along the road and through the forest like if it was a soft carpet. I knew that you had a higher tolerance to pain, but it looked that you weren’t feeling anything while I was continuously holding my complaints. I just wanted to arrive somewhere. You kept on saying that you knew where we were going, that it was close, that is was just a bit further up. Each time I discovered something about myself you answered with an “I know” that made me more and more confused about who you really were. At some point I thought you were an angel leading me to the sky, to the gods. At other points, I thought you were a Nymph of the forest that was going to make a ritual with me on the top. I even thought that K., Marte and others will be there waiting for us on the top, waiting to my arrival for giving me the deserved reward. I thought that you were testing me, that I had to prove myself to enter the realm of the divine. You kept on making comments about reality, about dimensions, about universe, about consciousness. My brain wasn’t ready to accept that. I was going crazy. The whole walk was really archetypical, and you were touching very deep and symbolic parts of my mind. You caught my brain off-guard because of the weed and the sleep deprivation. You were even tiring the self-control mechanism by reminding me all the time about silence and distance. Meanwhile, my body was trying to survive, trying to avoid drinking the scarce water that we had (“You are so unprepared, Carlos”), trying to avoid noticing the pain in the feet, legs, arms and back from the spines and the stones. Trying to function in their lack of nutrients and lack of sleep. I am not sure if this is true but walking next to you that evening is probably the most difficult thing that I have done to date. I was lucky enough I had you next to me, giving me water from time to time and motivating my masculine self to prove my strength and endurance to you. I wouldn’t been able to do it alone. However, you kept on pushing my limits. You gave me your handbag, and the Sherpa transformed into a lord. I was the servant; I was the one really below in the relationship. More pain, more unfocused attention, more distracted thoughts jumping to my mind, more fears about losing my soul and being on the top of the mountain, more unknown things that I wanted to know. For all the unknown things in life I kept on walking and following you. For the Tao. Higher and up, higher and up. More pain, more stones, more spines. I remember how I get trapped with my t-shirt in one plant. I was about crying of frustration and powerlessness. You were treating me pretty harshly, but I had my own medicine. I realized that I was treating many people in that similar way. We arrived at the stone, and you accepted to stop. There the angel leading me to the sky became the devil trading for my soul. Your way of communication was too perfect, too prepared, too skilled for me. “Who are you?” and “What do you want?” were the questions that I repeated and repeated all the time. For me, you couldn’t admit that you were the devil and that you wanted my soul. For me, it was the ultimate test to Carlito Fluito. The devil wants pure souls because those are the most valuable, those that can save other souls from misery and suffering. I had been crying about my willingness to save the world that morning. After days of fighting for fairness, justice, and love, and when I kept on seeing people giving up, I had been brought to the top of the mountain by you, a devil disguised like a beautiful woman. It all made sense in my mind at that moment. I was taking you from the head, looking into your eyes while you smiled me, and answered me “It doesn’t matter who I am”, and “I have already told you what I want”. At some point, you stopped looking like a beautiful woman to look more like an androgyne being, half male, half female, blue eyes, small breast, hair on the armpits, smiling at the sun, and with your hair in a bun done by my hands. You were the devil requesting my soul. My brain was melting from outside by the sun, and from inside by my thoughts. I was going to collapse. You took of your shirt, which I understood as an invitation of sex. It was a really suitable spot for having sex. Middle of the mountain, no interruptions, beautiful vistas. I imagined me asking you for the screams you couldn’t give me in the hostel in our nights together. I really wanted you to cry out all your pleasure to the mountain. But I was on the verge of collapse. You asked for distance from time to time, but then you were half naked in front of me, moving the bottle of water from your legs to your side, mentioning things like “I have taken the bottle away, there are no barriers anymore for me”. I was extremely confused. Was the devil going to trade my soul for having sex with him? Did the devil want my soul in exchange of a life of fame and endless energy and creativity? Was the fact of having sex with you in the mountain the pact of trading my soul? My mind was extremely confused. I knew I had sinned by smoking, and I knew that that was my penitence. At some point you even turned around, offering me your ass and I thought that what you wanted was a corporal punishment that I couldn’t give you either. We kissed for a bit and you clicked the tongue with disapproval. You were blocking my brain even more. I wasn’t able to fully surrender, and I was begging you to lie next to me on the path. You didn’t concede that either. I tried to get horny, but I couldn’t. Saying that I was tired or that it was the first time of my life that that happened sounded like excuses to me. Facts or not, I didn’t want to excuse myself. I shared with you some secrets in a low voice, and you reinforced my self-confidence making me talk louder. “Aeta!” I expressed my gratitude to you and the mountain. You kept on talking about my lack of empathy, my lack of trust, my lack of compassion, my lack of surrender, my lack of silence, and my lack of distance. Weed makes me unfocused and weakens my impulse control. You were asking me for both. You decided that we should keep on going up. I surrender. I accepted. I tied my t-shirt on my head to keep my mind together. The topic of trust kept on appearing and appearing again. I was questioning myself all the time whether my reactions to your comments and behavior were signals of luck of trust on you. But so many painful situations weren’t making any easier for my trust to develop. We stopped a bit further to drink water, but not for long. We continued more and more. I was dying, you had killed me, and it felt like you were dragging my corpse around the mountain. It felt like I was succeeding on tasks and test but there was never a reward, just teaching after teaching, and lesson after lesson, test after test. You had asked me before our departure what were my values, and I have answered “Growth”. I should have said “Love”. You kept on repeating that I could take the easy way, but that would mean that I wouldn’t grow that much. You kept on talking like if you already knew everything, like if you perfectly knew my answers and my thoughts. You kept on weakening my body and my mind. When we arrived to the big rock, where you climbed the tree, I was already defeated. I didn’t know when to talk and when to remain silent; I didn’t know when to stay close and follow your steps and when to be distant; I didn’t know when to ask and when to answer; I didn’t know when to quit and when to keep on walking; I didn’t know when to leave and separate from you, to detach from the journey, and when to convince myself that we should go till the end together. It all felt like my life was being that walk through the mountain. You record the conversation, so it would be lovely to come back to it on the future. We arrived at the big rock. We climbed it and I couldn’t think about anything else than lying there with or without you. I was already abandoning the possibility of you supporting me. You kept on going with your energy, with your games, climbing trees, and fooling around. I wanted to show my help and availability. To offer you my assistance in case you need it, but you reminded me that you were a strong and independent woman. I gave you space. I almost uttered a couple of times those non-invasive warning comments that I had read somewhere. Instead of “Be careful of what you do”, “Be conscious of how you are doing it”. But I was very unsecure, very tired. I wasn’t able to try and fail anymore. You had nullified me. I waited for you to climb the tree while carrying your handbag and being responsible of all your stuff. I was avoiding any comment, but couldn’t avoid thinking that if you fell, I would have to find energies from the deepest parts of my physiology to carry your heavy injured body down the mountain. I was afraid of you, afraid of me, afraid of everything. Fear is so tiring. I took your photo, still feeling unsecure about whether the quality of it was enough, or you would just complaint and derogatorily reject my attempts of approval, again. I was hopeless. You even mentioned that I talked too much for you, and you said it in a tone that was more determinant than I expected. I had learned to surrender already. Then, I learned silence. I just focused on my body, on my pain, on my vanishing supplies of energy, and kept on breathing and crying my tears in the direction of my soul. Then, from time to time, you started to speak. You spoke about topics that were deeply personal, and important for you, but you had destroyed my brain. You were expecting me to understand and follow every word you were saying, and I was even afraid of telling you that my mind wasn’t working anymore, that my attention, my memory, my perception wasn’t working. 30 seconds of rest meant for me and my body the perfect opportunity for falling sleep wherever I was. It all felt like a cruel punishment, a cruel test that I hadn’t asked for. It all felt like a trap that was leading me down and down to a world of suffering and pain. I thought that it served me to develop my empathy towards others, towards your suffering, but my being was too focus on its own survival for paying attention to other people. We find a road that went down. I just wanted to arrive, to finish the adventure, to assume that I had survived, but you pushed me a bit more. You had been polishing a walking stick and you asked me to take a shortcut crossing down the mountain because it was shorter. Few meters down, you offered me the stick, which kept me walking. That stick was really meaningful for me. I was becoming Moses; I was a prophet. Later on, you justified yourself telling me that no one forced me to do anything of what I did, and you might be right, but let the anonymous reader decide where the individual free will starts and ends. The way you were offering me the shortcut didn’t seem as an option, but as a duty, as another test to prove myself. We arrived at the house, and I was just thinking about entering a safe area, get some drink, some water, some food, and some rest. I offered you to try to meet the owners, to talk with other human beings. You accepted to cross the fence. I performed a somersault when we entered the grass and you said: “You enjoyed too much” and crossed back to the spines. It felt horrible to be punished for enjoying myself, but I assumed my lack of self-control and came back to the pain and the suffering. I was too tired to complain, or to express any type of anger or confrontation with you. I had already learned to surrender, to remain silent, and to suffer inwards. We arrived at the road and you found the blackberries. I could only lie down. You offered me some fruits and I eat them. After few seconds, I realized that it would be selfish to stay there lying down while you collected the fruits and I tried to help you. You sent me to the other side of the plant. I would have eaten them all, but surrender, silence, empathy, trust and self-control were, by that time, accumulated lessons. We kept on walking and at some point, you checked the smartphone. In any moment of the past I would have said that it was a big disrespectful behavior, but patience and ignorance were my personal reminders for keeping myself silent. You mentioned that the facilitators were looking for us, worrying for us, and with the idea of calling the police. I couldn’t believe any of what I was experiencing. I just wanted to arrive and rest, no drama, no anything. I asked you to speak for both, and I wished I was able to remain silent, trusting in your words, surrendering myself completely to you and the situation. I didn’t know what was going to happen, if they were going to expel us both or just me. I didn’t care much. I was hypoglycemic, struggling to keep myself walking. The berries gave me some energy, but not enough to care too deeply about anything. You had shared with me your fears of attachment and closeness on the mountain, and then on the road you shared how you have got to know the feedback of your audition. I was just listening. I was just giving you what you had asked me to give you: space, silence, trust, attention, surrender. I was just there for you. It felt really surprising to get to know later that you felt empty after our walk, when I had given you all the things you had asked me for. I am not sure whether you were playing with me all the time, or you were being genuine. It could be complementary to know your version of the story. We found the police, and we almost got into their car. I didn’t know if I should talk or not. Remaining silent was uncomfortable and talking would bring guilt. I was trapped in a paradox where both action and non-action were detrimental for my existence. We arrived and luckily, people didn’t want to talk with us. I went to the shower. Warm water. I cleaned myself and my clothes, dressed up and found K. and In. (Portugal) to explain me how it has been the day in the prison. I couldn’t barely move. There was no food without meat, and I eat K.’s peaches and fruits. You came to the room speaking about religion and God. The whole walk on the mountain had been a painful spiritual experience of growth and self-improvement. Religion and god are for kids, are simplifications of something much deeper, much more human, much more real, than a mystical force somewhere ruling the universe. Sometimes it feels nice to think that everything has sense and meaning that everything is already planned and that we are all part of a perfectly structured game. Actually, that was the feeling that kept on repeating during the exchange. Even Souna had asked me directly that day: “Do you think that everything happens for a reason?” like if she was going ad lib, departing from the script, like if it was a direct call to my being, to what I was experiencing, and to the fact that everything was already plotted. We had also talked about synchronicities, and you kept on squeezing my mind asking for meanings and definitions that I didn’t know, and I couldn’t came up with. “Do you believe in God?” you asked me. “I believe on you” I said. I assumed that for your smile and renewed energy you had just came from talking with O.. Even, the conversation topic was too religious for having experienced a divine epiphany. There had been a preacher between you and your new beliefs. I have had lots of talks with many religious people from many traditions. Muslims are quite interesting, since they are the monotheistic religion that is surviving and thrilling in times of the advancement of technology and science. Actually, their idea of god is really interesting, and the fact that they don’t humanize it, makes it more powerful and resilient compared with the Christian god that gets angry at humans and sends his son to be killed by us. Muslims concept of god is simpler and more powerful, more encompassing, and the rigorous practices that believers have to practice make them committed and convincing preachers. I am spiritual and poly religious. I believe on human beings, on humankind and on the infinite ignorance that we all have inside us. I am open to new views, but they should be views moving me towards growth, not towards comfort. Religion is easy, spirituality is challenging. I didn’t have any energy to argue at that point. I was just merely surviving in K.’s bed. It reminded me to my Vipassana experience, when, after my first committed meditation, I collapsed on the floor of my bed, just raising one arm, to prove myself that I wasn’t fully dead. Even further, you room had the element of Mar. entering from time to time to complain about my existence. I didn’t know what to do or what to say to her. Helping and caring didn’t seem to matter for her. She wanted something and it was the way it had to be done. No further discussion or argumentation. I went to the lunchroom. I tried to write, I tried to focus on something, I tried to sleep, I tried to try. My brain and body weren’t working. At some point, I quitted life. I went to my room and fell sleep. 1.7 Surrendering my soul to the world, making love with the universe (DAY 7 – 2019-08-01) I woke up pretty refreshed. I found you outside, taking the sun on the tatami. I shared with you the story of Paola, the girl I didn’t kiss when I was 11. You spoke about your fears of attachment, your insecurities and your Don Juan syndrome that kept on destroying your relationships. You told me how you get bored often about relationships, and how you end up as soon as you feel they are not contributing anything new in your life. The sessions started and I had perfectly learned my lesson. You had told me the previous day not to waste my energy during the sessions. I took my laptop and started working on my website, on the things that I had neglected from my life, on reorganizing and bringing back my duties. The session was pretty productive. I kind of interact a couple of times, but the distancing I got from the whole thing felt really good. I wrote about attachment and answered the question that the anonymous participant had suggested me. I took another look at the envelope and thought that you had written the one with so many teachings that you had told me on the mountain. Empathy, compassion, writing, letting go… It seems that the author wasn’t you after all, but In. (Portugal). Thus, she kept on saving me from the shadows. My head was still a bit of a turmoil, and you seemed perfectly secure, perfectly fine, perfectly at peace. I was still digesting the lessons from the previous day. I asked you about how to control my attention, but you couldn’t answer. We separated and I end up in the church, where I had restrained my impulses of having sex with you in front of a cemetery. I told my group that I would focus on myself. I entered the church and practice anapana (attention on the breath) for 30 minutes, just listening and attending to my breath. I went out, we filmed the video, and then I started training. Visualizations arrived to me as the correct tool in the correct moment. I was able to land the cork after few attempts. It was incredible how powerful the mind is. All seemed a huge synchronicity. I was feeling strong and energetic again. I went to the hall, skip lunch and kept on training, kept on visualizing. It was wonderful how fast I could advance just by interiorizing the movement before attempting it. After the lunch, I finished the text, I gave it to In. for correction and proofreading, and publish it on the website together with the slow-motion video she had recorded. A super-productive day. I was feeling thrilled again. I had learned my lesson, got detached from the exchange, do my own, learn and grow. Everything was in order again. 1.7.1 Attachment and spiritual evolution (2019-08-01) I Recently, I was asked the following question: “If I strip away my attachment to relationship and accomplishment who am I underneath?” I cannot answer who you are underneath, because I don’t know you. But I can try to say what you will become. The shortest and most spontaneous answer that I could say is: Free. When you strip away from your attachment, you will become free. But security is needed. II For Buddha, attachment was the cause of suffering. For every human being, including Buddha, attachment is the first relationship we develop with another being. Attachment exists because we are born dependent. You may have heard that human beings, out of all the known life in this universe, are the animals who are most dependent at the time of birth. Most people nowadays are familiar with neuroplasticity, the fact that the brain keeps on leaning and changing all over our lives and development (cite required). However, more people may be unfamiliar with the fact that the skull, the container of the brain, is not completely closed when we are born (cite required). Apart from facilitating the already painful birth to the mother, the softness of the bones of the skull in newborns allows the brain to develop and expand the fastest during our first years. Focusing on learning requires a safe environment. When we are unable to live by ourselves independently, the safety of an environment is determined by the people inhabiting that space, that universe. The famous experiments supporting this idea were carried out by Bowlby (cite required). Some mothers and their kids were in a room full of toys. The kids were playing around while the mother was patiently seated. At some point, the mother left the room leaving the kid alone. Healthy kids stopped playing, stopped exploring, stopped learning. All kids cry. They suffered at their realization of their loneliness, of their dependency, of their vulnerability. They expressed their fear, pain, and suffering by crying. Crying for help, crying for support. Crying for love. Love is the most effective pacifier. Love is built on trust. After a couple of minutes, the mothers entered the room and tried to pacify the kids. The ones that were familiar with the love of their mothers calmed down really fast. Those that couldn’t quickly connect and understand that the mothers had come back and were giving them love, took longer to calm down and return to an explorative behavior. Bowlby divided the reaction of the kids in several categories: secure, anxious-ambivalent anxious-avoidant, and disorganized. All excepting the secure, are insecure. (You can read more on Wikipedia about this). Then, the psychological literature made us believe that we are conditioned for the rest of our lives according to the type of relationship we developed with our first caregiver, mostly our mothers. People with secure attachment are related to better outcomes in many aspects of life. Interpersonal relationships (romantic, familial, friendship), goal achievement, academic success and such a long list of things that I grow skeptic of it (You can read many of these in Wikipedia as well, in the section of Attachment in adults). It is for me difficult to believe that the first relationship that we had is determining the rest of our lives. I agree that it is probably the strongest one that we will ever develop. None of us can remember the first years of our lives. The time when our attachment reaction was being built. Thus, we may underestimate its impact. But I deeply believe in change. I believe that human beings can change. I believe we can learn. I believe we can grow. III I used to have a pretty insecure attachment (sometimes anxious, sometimes ambivalent), but nowadays, believe me on this, I am doing much better. (You can take a look to my Unfinished Loves if it serves as inspiration). Personally, spirituality is, among other things, a deeper approach to human psychology, a more evolved one. Evolved and simplified. Buddha detected that attachment was the cause of suffering. Attachment was developed on us when we were extremely dependent on other human beings. We were completely vulnerable, and if it weren’t for our first caregiver, we wouldn’t be alive today. It’s that simple. Thus, it is simple to understand that this relationship keeps on affecting most of us after many years and in many aspects of our life. However, I think that we can grow. I don’t like the idea that we cannot control the outcome of our life, that who we are going to become depends on the type of one specific relationship we had. I believe in realizations. Realization is a pretty spiritual word. Learning is progressively discovering bits of reality. Realizations are fundamental alterations to the essence of our existence. Realizations are changes in our soul. Secure attachment means that we can explore the world feeling safe. Unsecure attachment means that we keep on feeling unsafe and that limits the realm of things that we can experience in this life. We all should forgive our mothers. At some point somewhere on our development, we needed our caregivers and they weren’t there. We suffer. We learned. We became insecure. The lesson: when we needed caregivers, they may not be there. We cannot trust people. Love is a limited and conditioned resource. IV Spiritually speaking, we can arrive at a different realization. The realization that love is within us and that depends on us to feel loved and secure. Thus, we will become free. Maybe this thought sparks fear on you. It sometimes does on me. This fear is another form of attachment. Attachment to our human nature. It is undeniable that attachment is human. However, I disagree with believing that is the most evolved form of love. Religion focuses on divinity, spirituality on humans. I like to define myself as a spiritual polyreligious person. Certain religions make us believe that the highest form of love is god. As a spiritual person, I am still attached to the idea that the highest form of love is manifested and enacted by human beings. God is just an easy metaphor. Letting go of our attachments will make us less human, more divine. The perils are that one of the most successful religions of our time is founded on the idea that a very spiritual person that named himself “the son of God” was eventually crucified. Christianity invites us to believe that proclaiming yourself divine will bring you suffering and persecution from society. Buddhism, on the other hand, was founded by a person that after years of conscientious and continuous introspective exploration realized the truth that attachment is the cause of suffering. Then, he developed a methodology to get rid of suffering and spend the rest of his life spreading it. V The person writing this is Carlito Fluito. I like to acknowledge my human reality while developing my divine potentiality. I am European, and Aristotle’s thought about where the virtue lies have affected me. We have to progress and collaborate as a species if we want to reach divine levels. We can change the weather at will, an outcome that was asked by Native American people by dancing around a fire. We are already creating life, modifying it, a skill that is given to any creator god in every mythology. We have huge abilities of destruction and punishment, a power that is given to warrior gods in many mythologies. We are thinking about conquering this universe. We are envisioning ways of creating new ones. If we are not god yet, we are becoming really closer. And still. We remain so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so human. We still remain so humans that while I am writing these words tears appear on my eyes. We remain fearing each other. We remain hiding our souls. We remain attacking each other. We remain feeling unsafe and insecure in this planet. We remain afraid of death. We remain attached to life. But humanity is not only negative things. The lesson that we have to learn from attachment is the potentiality of feeling love, of feeling loved. Spirituality is a coping mechanism. Spirituality brings new tools of control to situations that seem infinitely uncontrollable. Detecting love as a tool, and leaving away attachment is, from my point of view, the spiritual solution that human beings need as a species at this historical moment. So, what will we become once we strip away our attachment? Free. We will become free. In monotheism, God created the world, the universe, but he was so attached to it, that he kept on intervening. He intervened so much that send prophets, messiahs, martyrs, saints… to keep on correcting and modifying his original creation. Most religious believers praise a God that is still behaving, feeling, and thinking like a human (cite required). I choose not to praise Gods that are like humans when I can directly venerate humans. Spirituality is a simplification, an evolved simplification. Why should I praise God, when I can praise human beings? If we get rid of our attachment, we will become a more evolved form of spiritual beings. We may stop feeling human, and we may even fear that we will lose our capacity of love and be loved. But I don’t like to believe that. I prefer to think that leaving our attachments behind will transform us into a more evolved form of human beings. Humans that feel free, secure have the ability to love and be loved at will, independently of the behavior of another person, or the outcomes of a situation. Spirituality is the next step in our evolution as species. Detachment is a key step to take. I don’t know who you are underneath since I can only speak from my experience, from who I am, and from what I have discovered on my path. The question about who you are can only be answered by you. With this text, I just tried to mention some of the things you are likely to become when you do if you are willing to try it. I love to hear your questions and comments. Danyabad for reading. For you that read this far: This is how I feel when I am free of attachment.2 My. tried to talk with me for a while. She asked me if I was okay, if everything was going well, and she showed interest on me when she tried to speak about my main occupation in Spain, “I am living in Brussels”. She was surprised, and then she asked me what I was doing. I answered in my funny way of “1 to 5” in level of complexity of the answer. But for her, I told her to choose “1 to 5” among my occupations there. One to four where “Ph.D. student”, “Dancer and performer”, “Yoga teacher”, and “Youtuber”. Luckily and funnily, she chose five: — I am taking care of a dog. His name is Mortimer. She was obviously, pretty puzzled. — But, that is what you do in Brussels, for living? — Well, it is one of the things I do, yes. Indeed, I had been living in Brussels for already a year and a half as dog sitter. So, all was good. She tried to continue the conversation, asking me what were the other occupations, but I told her that it was better not to know everything at once. That she could come back later and talk more if she wanted. She was sort of annoyed by my behavior, but I was just being clear and straightforward. She could have come before to asked me who I was. I understood better the importance of inner control vs. outer control, and how I should give to people once they asked for something, not before. I mastered silence, I mastered surrender. I worked hard on my compassion which since the meditation of the previous day, I was starting to feel more clearly on my body. You did the energizer of killing hearts with the fingers. It was my small revenge to show you that I was back on the game, full mode and ready to play. It kept on confirming my expectations the fact that even Igor, physically fit and older than me, couldn’t touch me even once. I was feeling unbeatable. I kept on observing people during the sessions, and I found you groggy and tired. I wrote notes to many participants, to spread my thoughts on their envelopes, and I gave one to you with your own lesson: “Don’t waste energy on the sessions, save it for later”. I wanted you to be fresh for the night, just in case. I did my last laundry, and then, I package my stuff in the backpack. I had learned, and I was planning to leave. We share a moment on the bathroom, when I watched you wetting your nape. It was wonderful to be there, the two of us alone, feeling the sexual tension of the moment, and keeping myself on the distance, enjoying the pressure. I decided to keep on focus on myself. I told And. that if people asked about me, he could say that I had gone running. Telling that to And. would mean no further questions from him, and a disclosure just when the situation became publicly dramatic. I run up the mountain. I followed part of what we had done the previous day. I was actually looking for you, K. and Marte. I thought you had gone to the castle and I wanted to join. I kept on going up, much easier than the previous day. Barefoot, with high levels of attention and concentration, being very aware of my body, with my t-shirt on my head, keeping my thoughts together. I took an apple. I bit it. It was my jaw protector in case I fell. Also, it worked as a coping mechanism, and tension liberator each time thoughts and fears arrived at my mind about you or about our conversation of the previous day. The stones and the spines hurt, but not as much as before. I kept on running up the mountain, on following the path, because this time there was no need of extra-pain. Running I realized that pain can be a certain type of love for some people. The pain that you caused me while having sex, the pain that you had made me go through the previous day, the pain that your parents had given to you when you were a kid. I was a warrior again. I was a wild animal. I was a sapiens surviving and ready to fight. I took a shit somewhere close to the top of the hill. I cleaned my ass with the nature, just to prove myself that I was one with the environment. I took a shortcut across the hill. Climbing on my monkey style, using four extremities instead of two. I collected some glass, so there were less chances that the whole forest became ashes one day. I reached the castle. But I still wanted more. The apple had the perfect mark of my teeth. My fears, my rage, my focus was there on that apple. My silence was on the apple. I shouted a couple of times. Cries of monkey, screams of mammal, yells of ape. Once in the castle I devise a route for climbing. I had done few climbing exercises during the day, but I looked for the real experience. I climbed up the wall, higher and higher, like a lizard. I was deeply afraid, fully conscious that a bad movement, a moment of lost concentration, or a loose stone would mean the end of the adventure. I knew I was pretty alone in the top of the hill, that there was no one around, that no one knew where I was, and that a fell from that height would mean my direct disability if not my death. But I climbed anyway, and I observed the vistas feeling my fears and thoughts in the depths of my being. I bit the apple and calmed down. More extenuating that the hiking up the hill was to be there, fighting against my fears. I understood a bit better how fearful people need to sleep so much, why they are always tired. Fear was extremely tiring. Fear is highly consuming. I lied down on the top of the wall, with my hands and feet hanging on the void. I calmed down my heart and breath. Accepted that I didn’t need to go further to prove myself anything else, and calmly descend again to the ground. I had risked my life. Consciously and willingly. I had detached from life. I was freer, more powerful, stronger, more alive. I was Carlito Fluito. The same that had contained his tears while being beating up to extenuation by you for hiking up a mountain that he never asked to hike. That Carlito Fluito was now a beast, a warrior, a fighter, a survival. I had run up the mountain, barefoot, as you had told me; I had empty my bowels like an animal; shouted and screamed like an ape; climbed like a lizard; observed the horizon like an eagle; and confronted my fears like a human. I was a fully spiritual being. I descended running. Wanting to arrive on time to the reflection group. The word of the day came to my head, clear and translucent. “Silence”. Silence would hack the system. “What was good today? What could have been better? What did you learn? What would you apply for the future?” Silence. My silence to all of you. The reflection group was extremely ridicule. K. left for a phone call, you started piercing the paper, and when we started reading the objectives and goals, I couldn’t help myself but laugh aloud. It was like coming back to my 6 years old class. By no means, I was going to read that bullshit. I wrote that I had been born there and now and I left the paper. I was training my climbing skills on the hall with O. and G. when you arrived. I felt superior again. I felt strong. O. was trying the exercises that I was doing with ease. I had been working the whole day on my climbing skills, and we compared ourselves in front of you. We, males, are this type of beings that think that their bodies represent their masculine worth. I couldn’t like winning more. I couldn’t like improving myself more. I felt so strong, confident and secure that I was ready to come back to you. To play a bit and check if you were still the strong and quick minded devil that had caught me unguarded the previous day on the hike up the mountain. I bit my apple and looked at your eyes. I remained silent, smiling, enjoying the feelings of power and superiority. I had realized your relationship with pain. The puzzle had become something much more meaningful. Your games, your willing for playing, your desire of control, your sadistic way of having sex. I had caught you. You mentioned that you weren’t planning to have sex with anyone in that exchange, or at least with anyone that was present there. That meant you had O. on mind. I knew it. But you didn’t know what I had discover. “I know what you want” I said. “Tell me”. “Not here, come on…”. I had rehearsed that dialogue on my mind while going down the mountain. We excuse G. for his presence, and we left the hall. “I feel like if I am walking my pet” I told you. I was ready to fight back. We looked into each other eyes, I kept on smiling, on playing with your distance, on biting your lips, your neck, on interiorizing the pain when you pounded down your nails on my chest, on grabbing your hair when you bit me on the arm. I got you. We were playing and then you were mine. You weren’t getting bored anymore, you were getting nervous because you were losing, you weren’t sure if you wanted to keep playing. You even broke the rules and threw my apple away. I breathed in and out. I didn’t care. My dick was hard. The same dick that couldn’t have had an erection in the mountain was ready to pierce you in revenge of the pain you have caused me. The same dick that you loved to introduced in the throat, that throat filled with mucous that weren’t able to leave your body, that throat where the sensations of annoyance and boredom manifested, that throat that someone with the minimal knowledge about chakras would identify as an energetic blockage on the Vishuddha center. You asked me if I wanted to hear your feelings. You had already mentioned that you wouldn’t have sex in the exchange, or maybe just with O.. I didn’t want to hear your feelings and how much you liked O.. That is what I feared and that is why I said that not at that moment. You felt deeply hurt for my lack of availability. Mir. and some other facilitators passed by. We moved to a more private location. We went to the park and you changed the strategy. You were more honest, more sincere, you started to open up. You mentioned your rituals and self-injuries. You mentioned how you saved your cat. I was still in a playful way. I wasn’t sure if you kept on playing or not. I couldn’t know if you were performing another role or you were genuine. I was confused again, and I didn’t know how to act. I was defensive. You asked me for help, but help, control, power, energy, are expected to be found inside. That is my philosophy, that’s my spirituality. I am not a God or a guru giving you the answers, offering you excuses to exert external control over you. I am just a human talking to a human explaining that is all inside, we like it or not. You asked me why you were keep on playing, you told me that you wanted to stop playing, but I wasn’t sure whether I should believe or not. You had reminded me so many times about trust the previous day that I wanted to believe in your words. I tried and then realized that it was you the one that didn’t trust on me. “Am I playing with you?” “Yes.” “Do you trust me?” “Yes.” These two questions were denying each other. I had talked to you about “The Game”, about all those guys that had envisioned a huge range of techniques of strategies to transform complete strangers into loyal girlfriends. I had told you that with you I hadn’t had the need of doing any of that, that the learning was there on the back of my mind, knowing what to say and what not to say at a certain moment, but that my relationship with you from the beginning had been genuine. That I hadn’t calculated any kiss, that I had exposed myself to be rejected repeated times, that I had looked for you, that I had left you messages of vulnerability, and that I had open up led by trust, not by compromise mechanisms. I had been restless and sleepless waiting for you to appear on my room. You kept on saying that I was playing with you, and I kept on saying that you were not trusting my words. You unlock another piece of my being, a deep and profound one. I looked into your eyes. I was hanging from the ropes of the pyramid, you were already seated, playing with the wood. “Thank you, A.. I stop playing.” You kept on teaching me all those deep lessons, I kept on learning from you, while you complained that our encounters left you empty. The lesson is on the student, not in the teacher. You had left me extremely full and obstructed after our mountain hike. I remined you of the power of emptiness on the notes of the envelope, you My Sherpa. You seemed never satisfied, never at peace. Nothing was enough for you. On the other hand, I felt like I was continuously learning, continuously growing, expanding, transforming, improving the previous versions of myself. You were there saying that it wasn’t about me that it was about you, that you didn’t even know if you wanted to stop playing or not. As a psychologist, I learned that I cannot convince a person of anything if they don’t want to be convinced about it. I tried a bit of hypnotherapy, but you reject it automatically as well. I didn’t know what to do with you. You didn’t show any signs of cooperation, and I was already assuming that I had learned all the lessons I had to learn from that exchange. I was getting familiar with the idea of leaving the place walking during the next morning. You told me that I wasn’t cooperating, but I was doing my best, and if my best wasn’t enough, then my best was ready to leave you and leave that place. I was feeling deeply at peace, deeply powerful, deeply complete and finished. I told you again that we could stop playing all together and you kept on repeating that it wasn’t about me. “It is not about you, Carlos.” “I know, but we can start with me.” But you didn’t understand. I didn’t understand. You chew those sticks of wood, that then you buried. You were embodying a regression to a previous version of your self. You were enacting a kid A. that was learning about love. The following night you confessed that you learn love from K., and two days later, I told you my believe about you that you think that the love you give is not “right” or “correct”. Anyways, you had repeated me many times that you wanted to come back to the hostel. So, we did. We separate again. I found Mir. and we continued with our previous conversation. The first thing I asked her was that in case I would leave, I wanted to leave walking. That was all, no cars, no confusions, no messages, no calls, no warnings, no anything. She said that no one had threatened me with expelling me out. She said I was spreading fake news. I didn’t want to argue. It wasn’t time for bullshit. I tried once more, with all my peace, all my inner power and control. I tried once more with all my non-violent communication. I tried to let her see what had happened along those days, how the dynamics of the group and myself had changed, how people had left and abandon the project, how they had gotten disengaged, how I had quitted, how I had learned my lesson. I tried to see if she had learned hers. She hadn’t. She told me that I had changed a lot from the first days, and I took that as a proof of my growth. She couldn’t receive my feedback, she kept on excusing herself about the benefits of going to the mountains, of being more flexible with the free time, of being less attached to their project. “Being honest and direct, I think that your fears are limiting your growth.” She asked me who I was and what did I want. I told her that I had grown a lot, enjoyed the experience a lot and that I was ready to depart at peace. I told her that I enjoyed promoting other people’s growth and that the way to promote their growth the most was to withdraw myself from the situation. I fully believed what I was saying. We agreed that in case of leaving, I could leave walking. We agreed that I hadn’t completely decided what to do, and that I would see next morning. I had completely realized that the organizers hadn’t learned their lesson yet. I went to the room, share my thoughts with the roommates. Went to the kitchen and eat some raw vegetables and fruits. Then, looked for you in the room. I was on fire, I still had energy for more. I didn’t want to play with you, but just to figure it out when was going to be our last interaction and what was the healthiest level of depth and connection before our separation. I found you on the bed. You were distant. I was pure love and compassion. Mar. kept on complaining, but you protected me. You wanted me there and I stayed there. I lied next to you, offered you my love and support, and at some point, breathing in and out, I opened my soul to the world. I felt the surrender in the depths of my existence, I felt extreme sensations of bliss and peace. I felt evaporating myself on the cosmos. I was so infinitely thankful and recharged. Mar. came back, and she kicked me out. I was just experimenting compassion for her. There were no side feelings, just a recognition of her pain and sorrows. I thank her and leave you. I spend the rest of the evening saying goodbye to the people that had made an impact on my experience there. I said thank you to B., to Maf., to An., to Lo., to Ra., to all of those that wanted to listen to me. I was calm and firm. Expressing my decision to everyone. “The moment has arrived. I am leaving” (living?). There was no pain, no resentment, no regret. I was just assuming my lesson. I was surrendering to what life and the universe were giving to me. I didn’t want to think much about how to get to Strasbourg, or what to do there for a couple of days. I was living the present moment, being there, enjoying my farewells with all of them. Some tried to convince me. “It is only two days more” But it didn’t matter, the same way I would have fought to the last of my breaths when I was a warrior, I would have surrendered in the last of my seconds when I was a surrender. It wasn’t about the timing; it was about the decision. I found you with my roommates outside. I had already talked with O. in the kitchen about you and him. He couldn’t have stated me clearly that he had kissed you, whether he liked you or not, whether he had intentions towards you or not. I repeated that I knew, that I had talked with you and that it was okay. I just wanted to know, but he didn’t speak. It didn’t matter much. Whatever you would do when I left wouldn’t be part of my story, of my existence. I laugh with my roommates, we cheered with our glasses of different liquids, and I express my gratitude as I had done with the rest. “None of this wouldn’t have been possible without you”. I really meant it. In the same way that I meant leaving. I had hung the clothes a bit too late and it would take time to dry, but that would be the indicator of my departure. If people wanted me to stay, they could pour water over my clothes. My roommates showed their loyalty and respect by leaving me alone with you for our last night. I wasn’t sure whether you were going to stay or not. G. took a bit longer in leaving. He kept on dreaming about kissing me again, he kept on focusing on the callings of his gonads. But he understood the situation and left. We lied down and talk. I fell asleep a couple of times and dreamed about you. I had that dream where you were escaping from some beasts, maybe those dogs of your story, the ones you have talked with. In the dream, I realized that I couldn’t offer you anything else than my silent and stoic protection. I didn’t have to lift you up, or to fight your beast for you. I could just hold the beast while you get time to raise up yourself. I was there to protect you. I understood that you weren’t seeking for love, for support, for help. Just protection. To feel secure. My signals of affection, silence and distance, opened you up little by little, and we let the passion evolved. “Hello again, A.”. You asked me to be gentler with you and you behaved more gently with me. We made love. I went to the room for some condoms, water and to wash my mouth because, green pepper smell like cabbage, you know. Then, there on the tatami and with a couple of blankets we had sex. K. interrupted us for a bit when she arrived in the car of her new boyfriend, which it also made me realized all the things that were going on in front of me and I hadn’t been able to see, like K.’s calls and talks on the phone. She left us and we continue our love making. I had you against the wall, I had you below me, I had you above me. I wanted to give you pleasure, lots of pleasure. At some point, I realized that I was making love with the universe. I was seeing the starts while holding your head and penetrating you. The devil that the previous day had traded for my soul was now giving me hers. I had already surrendered my soul to the world before on the bed. I had said goodbye to everyone. There was no soul to take. I was experiencing that blissful Taoist emptiness while practicing non-ejaculatory sex with you and the universe at once. You came and, almost automatically, switched back to selfish, playing mode. But I wasn’t playing. It was too late for that. As I had told you, for me games were over, it was all real, all genuine. I had told you that you had been my most truthful relationship. The most genuine, the sincerest. In a Fake News exchange speaking about truthful relationships and wearing my Truth is non-violent t-shirt, the situation became even more meaningful. I had asked you where you want me to come, and I was saving it for you, for the right moment, as a reward of your collaboration, of our relationship, or your teachings. But surprisingly, your orgasms transformed you back to that old A. focused on herself and her games. It wasn’t anymore the A. I had said hello when we had started kissing passionately. But, you know, I couldn’t care less. I had done what I had to do, and life kept on developing as it had to. You talked in dreams about the piece you wanted to do with your theater classmates and how you had decided who was which animal on your imagined performance. You were sexually satisfied, and I had the universe above represented on the hundreds of the starts that the mountain was gifting me. All the energy of my sperm was still running through my system. I would use it tomorrow, no problem at all. It felt as if I had broken the wheel of reincarnation. As if I had reached Nirvana and was free of all suffering in the future. We slept together outside, under the blankets, naked, our bodies one next to each other. I would think about leaving the exchange once more next morning, now that I had reconnected with you, reconnected with me, and reconnected with life. I felt at peace, I felt tired, I felt your body, I felt the fresh air of the night, and the endless sky filled with stars. I fell asleep. Deeply asleep. 1.8 Enjoying the exchange (DAY 8 – 2019-08-02) I woke up several times by the sunrise. I woke up also by K.’s yoga which gave me a wonderful view of her ass, considered as a masterpiece by the most rigorous critics, and the mountain on the background. You were sleeping next to me. I fell asleep again and then I dreamed that I ejaculated on your mouth as you have asked me the previous night. I woke up confirming what I suspected. My swimming pants were filled of semen. I left you and went straight to the shower. Clean up myself, and without anything to dry, crossed the gym wetting the wood that I had tried to protect. The same wood that I had checked the first day. Lessons stuck on my back. I told you that you had missed a good one and got ready to start the day. I changed myself on the room and went into the kitchen to get an apple. M. T. found me and pushed me on the chest. Just another proof of how things were getting awry. But I couldn’t care less. I had slept with you, said goodbye to everyone, and release a meaningful part of my energy few minutes ago. I looked at her with compassion, thinking how dangerous can be someone that takes apples from the kitchen for self-consumption. It made the rest of the day much funnier, since I had to use my climbing skills around the building to get the food I needed and deserved. I did the energizer of cooperating and trusting, of standing into each other on groups. People laugh, I enjoyed watching. I realized that I can enjoyed my experience there by being detached, by being a spectator of the show that life was offering me. For the activity of the videos, people made groups and I choose mine when I wanted, based on the people, the venue, and the location where I could place myself to work on my laptop. Eventually, I worked with An. in a text that I tried not to over-direct and control. However, I wanted things done, so I rushed a bit. An. had been lovely the previous day, while we were saying goodbye and she was high. We had hugged and smiled to each other so much that was difficult to express another thing than love to her. We did the text, and I prioritized my needs. I went around the rooms, talking and enjoying myself with people. I was thinking about taking a nap, but it was almost lunch time. I talked with Lu., Li., and La.. I got to know them a bit better. I told them that I had found my role and place in the project, that I was enjoying watching the performance, that I had become a spectator, free of outcome, and fully detached of the result. I was free. I was myself again, training my body skills, doing climbing exercises, balance, strength and stretch development. Everything was getting into its place again. At lunch, we ate together. You fed me from your food, directly with your hands. I knew we both were dirty animals; we were just there enacting it for everyone. We bit and scratch each other for a while, talk about our lives and our relationship, show affection from time to time. I felt secure and at peace, I was enjoying myself and the moment a lot. After a while, I went inside and kept on observing and admiring. I found O. talking with Ab. in Arabic and I asked them to continue for me while I finished all the vegetables that were left. I even drunk beer when you appeared, and played a bit to social games with you, O. and Irene. I was there for myself. After the session started, I decided to keep on focusing on me. I went to sleep and took a siesta. A siesta that felt amazingly good. People were presenting their videos when I woke up. I could see mine and be admired at yours. I had the intuition that you had been the main brain behind it. It looked great. Somehow there was no reflection group. Neither I needed it. Dinner arrived, and we found each other outside under the blankets again, in our spot next to the stairs. Mar. arrived, because it wasn’t enough for her to kick me out of my room, she was feeling to attacked by me getting your attention so often. Then you confronted us, the positive and the negative forces, one against each other. I didn’t feel like fighting or anything similar, but you kept on pushing us. She proved herself deeply intelligent and deeply hurt, with a dark past that was affecting a promising future. K. joined us, and you proposed us to smoke. I told you to take care of me, but you partly refused the responsibility. You mentioned that, in a similar way as in the restaurant, you couldn’t be the babysitter. That is why I had to protect myself from the world. I didn’t smoke much, and I had already learned a lot about how to pacify myself. However, it happened what I feared. Once I remain silent, people keep on finding excuses to be annoyed by my existence. People keep on feeling uncomfortable by the fact that another human being is enjoying life so much to realms and to the extent that are unthinkable for them. In parties, people keep on asking which drugs I have taken, and I answer “water and air” admiring their disbelief. Mar. and you complained about my breath, about my most fundamental and unreducible behavior. If people complain about my way of breathing means that my existence is making them feel uncomfortable. But I was willing to take the feedback, to keep on breathing. Mar. mentioned a verse of the Tao and compared my breath with the one of a beast, and reminded me that the purest beings, newborns, breath unnoticeably. I took note. Later on, I was so focused on myself, on my breathing, on my silence, and on my non-interruption and intervention on life and the moment, that I fully missed the fact that you wanted to lie down under the blankets, and that I had all the pillow for myself. Maybe it was a bit overacted, but at that point, it felt like the perfect lesson at the perfect timing. You and K. were questioning my altruism and kindness and I got revealed myself by showing my selfishness in holding the pillow only for myself. I didn’t know if the whole thing was going to end up in a ménage-a-trois or not. I didn’t care much. I had so much trust on myself and life that whatever the outcome I would be happy. If it weren’t for you two that night, it would be with someone else on the future. No anxiety, no trying, no effort. Just surrender and let things happened. We gave some feedback to each other. K. mentioned that I had to speak my mind more often, which was in direct opposition to my attempts of remaining silent. I told to Mar. to help the world on a daily basis, to be more helpful, more selfless, more altruist. You said nothing. K. left. Me and Mar. came back to our performance for you, but the feeling of being your actor, your puppet was too hierarchical for me. I knew your future studies as a director and I gave you a piece of it, but I wasn’t willing to give you the whole cake for free. So, I included you in the performance. After a while Mar. left, and you told me that you were coming back. I could have waited for you, but I wanted to play, I wanted to climb. I had already eaten some tomatoes from the plant, and I was thinking about challenging and discovering new ways around the building. I climbed the wall and observed the people on the gym through the window. K. was intelligent like a dolphin. You were extinct like a lynch, and I was astute like a fox. I went to your room through the window, then open the right windows of the gym for later taking the needed resources, leaving the right things on the right places. But somehow, I found you on the gym, and I found the music there, and I stayed for training and dancing. People was chilling around and I had lots of things to train and improve. You were moving from one place to another. I didn’t know what where your plans, so I made mines. You played songs that I didn’t like, but I didn’t say anything. I had full trust on you. People joined and danced. An., Maf., In., the Turkish drunken and clumsy one. I was just trying to keep the dance floor as sacred as possible, clean and without interfering objects or liquids, but people are careless, and they like to drink and spill over. Well, what can I do, maybe chaos is what they want? I want chaos within the order, I like sex pure, and I drink water from other people’s mouths. I started having my paranoid thoughts about end up eaten by a bunch of cannibal girls that had fallen in love with my flesh, very much inspired by Suskind. I kept on dancing, unsure of what was my role on that whole thing. I thought that you had every step planned, every movement predicted. You were doing your thing and I just had to let you do. That is what I did, I danced for myself, I danced with the girls. I could have kissed some of them, but I didn’t know about how you would take it, so I refused to do it. I didn’t know where all was going. At some point the rest of the people entered the room. They were noisy, they weren’t dancing, they were complaining about the music. They were annoying me, but I was focused on myself, dancing and improving my moves. You remained on a side, silent and calm. Receiving some love you didn’t believe on. You went to sleep at some point, almost without saying good night. I climbed a couple of times to your room, to talk with K., to be kicked out by Mar., and to check whether you were there at all or not. I was giving you the so demanded distance, so I even didn’t try to go to your bed. I wanted to sleep with you outside, but I assumed that those weren’t your plans. I went out and found In. (Portugal). I had told her the day before to go and look for Canberk. She had done it with ambiguous results to my understanding. I offered her the possibility of talking about her emotions. We went outside to the stars. She talked for a while. I fell sleep. She left me. I thank the universe again the opportunity that had given me of being alive and fell asleep deeply this time, at peace, and feeling grateful and connected. 1.9 Getting ready to say goodbye (DAY 9 – 2019-08-03) I woke up and show an ant downside up. I empathized with its suffering and with a gentle blow I put it back to its normal position. First good thing of the day done. It was the last day. The moment had arrived. I had survived, but I was still on time for leaving. People kept on asking me why I hadn’t leave, and I came up with the joke of “I am living” as a misunderstanding and to avoid the Fake News terminology all around our heads. Even M. T. interpellated me contemptuously saying that if I wasn’t leaving. People were doing the youth pass and for me that was the greatest lie to myself that I could came up with. How to put in their words my lessons, how to reduce myself to their sentences, to their wishes. I accepted to do it by filling the shortest sentence in each category. Problem solved. Obviously, I wasn’t going to take seriously anything of what was left. I spend the morning climbing around, observing people, playing with them and with my body. During the evaluation, I had a really clear thing on mind. I wouldn’t give them the information that had been rejected before. I had mastered silence, and if anyone wanted more information, they could come to me. Obviously, I had grown, I had connected, I had learned, and I had done all those things written in the papers scattered on the floor. But it didn’t matter. It mattered my inner transformation. My surrender, my silence, my compassion, my empathy, my selflessness, my detachment from life. All those things that none of the organizers were responsible for. I had repeated that “None of that would have been possible without you (all”). But it was too much to give them the credit of my change. The credit was mine, for learning, for being always open to the teaching. Obviously, without you, A., it wouldn’t have been possible at all, but this you know it already. And., Ma. and many others expressed their complaints. Some remained silent, like Mar., who was the perfect negativist. When the evaluation was over, I approached Ma. and shared the experience of my first project in France. She reconsidered hers. I told her that learning depends on us, and we are responsible of our existence in this planet. We are what we get. We get what we give. Lunch time and I proved my super climbing skills by bringing the fajita through the window. We all eat together, and you were more affectionate than normal. You almost even texted me for a hug. People were cleaning, or sort of, and we were just avoiding any type of collaboration and responsibility. Fair enough. Some people left to the castle and you and I chose each other. We kiss, we let passion grow, and we start having sex on K.’s bed. Since it was unprotected sex on your room, we agreed that it was smarter to go somewhere else. I showered all the dirt from the day and the climbing, while you were thinking about, I don’t know what. You kept on telling me from time to time to annoy you. You wanted an excuse to hate me, but I wasn’t giving you any, even when I was trying. We went to the room, have a bit of sex, and then talk about who we were and where we were going. The two models of reality were confronted: my supposedly superficial positive attitude towards life and its challenges; and your deeply and thoughtful approach with constant negative and torturing connotations. You told me about some episodes of your past, some of your self-injuries, the psychopath that you wished to killed you and I reminded you about my intentions of getting a life reminder about the suffering of human beings that want to end their existence at some point of their lives. People came back. I tried to speak with M. T. for a last time, just to be at peace completely, to close the circle. M. T. was the original cause for me to had been there. She had invited me, and because of her, all those things had happened. I tried but she behaved like a kid. She talked ironically, condescending, avoiding my questions, avoiding seriousness, teasing me… I didn’t know what to do. I was trying to behave like a serious adult, and I found that surrealist conversation that was leading us nowhere. I accepted that there was no fruitful outcome for our conversation, and I thank her for all she had done. M. T. , like you, thought that I was a manipulator. Sad for you and for me to know that whenever I consciously try to manipulate things it merely doesn’t work. She said that I had gone there to find people for my sect, that that was what I wanted, the reason why I was there. I shared my experience and what I had learned and changed. I told her that I enjoyed giving voice to people, developing independent and functional individuals, observing their improvement and growth, helping and facilitating their own masteries. She didn’t believe a word of what I say. For her, and I fear that for some others, I had gone there to take control and power over everything, to manipulate everyone, to put some people against others, and to destroy and boycott the whole exchange. Well, those were her beliefs. I pity her, practice my compassion and let her go. I came back to the hostel and talked with the participants, offering them activities to give feedback to each other, like the game of guessing adjectives we had played before. I explained my encounter with M. T. and Mir. to some that were still willing to listen and told them what I had been called. Those that knew me a bit better laugh at it and supported me. For a second, I even questioned myself whether I was there to make my sect or not… Receiving their blind support and trust was a bit weird, but I had to get familiar with it. I talked with A. B. during the dinner. I tried to listen to her feedback. She told me that she liked a lot the Carlos of the beginning and that she didn’t understand my transformation. Well, for me was extremely obvious, and I don’t think she liked that much that Carlos that had written on a piece of paper “I want A. B. to take notes during our meetings”. Anyway, I took the feedback with a healthy dose of skepticism. For me, she was still taking things too personal, still struggling with her insomnia, still missing the main point of the situation. I remember Mir. comment about how I had changed so much in so little time that she wasn’t able to recognize me. I took that as a real and solid compliment. I felt compassionate for her and joined the secret friend revelation. I teased you once more on the chair by giving you my back. “It would be very embarrassing if I don’t recognize this body.” Maybe we could have touched each other more often. Maybe people could have been more tolerant with public signs of affection. Anyway, I had fun. The youth pass awards were another mocking performance for me. My mind was already on the next day, on Strasbourg, on my freedom, on spending the day together, far from all that theater that I hadn’t fully understood, all that charade that I had taken so much from. I enjoyed some sangria; I was there for some pictures. I found you on the park. I took my position on the hall and kept on enjoying the show. I didn’t know what was going to happen between you and me, but I was okay with it. The anxiety of the past was completely gone. I obviously wanted to sleep with you, but who knew what the future had prepared. I made fun of Cs. and her drunkenness and laugh a bit at myself feeling like the king of the place. I disappeared for a while. You disappeared for a while. And at some point, you said you were going to sleep. I caught you on the corridor and I convinced you to sleep together. No sex, you said. I didn’t care. We went to the room. We hug. You asked for distance. We kissed. You asked for distance. I was also tired. We fell asleep. 1.10 We got the love (DAY 10 – 2019-08-04) The moment of saying goodbye. You were kinda horny in the morning, and I am always up to have some sex. You kept on saying that you wanted to be annoyed with me. You kept on playing with my distance. You kept on complaining about me while rubbing my dick. I just let you do. I had surrender and accepted life completely. We stayed on bed as long as possible, saying goodbye thought the window. You asked me if we were a good couple. I told you that we could become one after a month or two of adapting to each other. Interruptions of K., Mar., E., O. People coming and passing. People leaving in their cars, and you and me completely unknown of the time we were supposed to leave. Enjoying our last moments together on the bed. You were probably thinking, I was surely feeling. I enjoyed giving and receiving affection. I tried to play but you didn’t like it. Who knows, maybe you were liking it too much. After a lot of snoozes, the moment arrived. You left and I got ready in less than five minutes. I collected all the fruits I could before leaving, and we jumped to the same car. In other projects I was really excited and emotional the last day, the day of the departure. In that one, I was at peace, knowing that I had transformed, that I had grown, that I was extraordinary. That I had made friends, that I had got to know you, that my life was different, and my love relationships had changed forever. I had already said goodbye two days ago, so I didn’t feel any regret or rush for not saying goodbye to anyone that morning. I talked with the girl driving the car to let you space for thinking and feeling whatever was going on in your head. I tried not to flirt much with her, at least consciously. There was no point on that. We arrived at the train station and bought the tickets. I helped Ir. and Ra. I wanted to spend the day with you in Strasbourg. That was my plan. Irene gave me feedback and told me that things could have been different. I told her that things had been simply as they were supposed to be. I felt tons of compassion for Mar. that was crying. I felt lots of love for all of you that were there with me. We arrived at Strasbourg, said goodbye to Ir. and E., and walked to the center. I was coming back to reality very slowly and gently. I was practicing all the things I have learnt: my surrender, silence, compassion, enjoyment of what life was giving me. I had that feeling of being the male of the tribe walking around a jungle with my three women. You asked for mojito and since I had the money, I was feeling altruist, and it would increase the enjoyment of the whole group, I agreed to buy mojito. Later on, we kept on walking and looking for a park to chill. We stopped by at a McDonalds where we almost left Mar. for her endless negativity. The walk was long, and the sun was high. Mar. wasn’t helping and K., you and I weren’t walking without much talking. We teased a bit more Mar., and eventually we arrived at the park. We bought some ice-cream, blueberry and blackberry, great flavor choices by the way. We found a grass, we lied down, we took some pictures, we rest for some time. We talked a bit, and we gave affection to each other. For me it was the perfect thing to do. Share some food, share some time, share some love. I was still amazed of Mar. and her insecurities at asking us for food. I was pitying her inside so deeply. We had some intimate moments, and I reminded you about my reminder. You started building that toroid of hair to put in my necklace. You had told me the day before that you were not a piece of collection and I answered that you already were. Unfinished loves is a book that will never be finished. Humanity should assume this as early as possible. I still look at your hair with proud and amusement. It is so significative for me. To have a part of your being hanging so close to my heart. You, that have cured my insecurities; you, that have gone to the depths of my mind, that have played with my archetypes, that have taught me surrender, compassion, silence, distance, trust… You, that have shown me that feeling secure depends on me. Some of your bites and scratches are already disappearing. My body is healing. The scars are fading out. However, I have your hair there, waiting for me. The fact that you included pubic hair make the present even more meaningful and enjoyable for me. As a minimalist, I didn’t have anything spare and meaningful to give you. The only thing that I could think about was the two post-it stuck together. I had taken them as a personal reminder of my attempt of democracy, as a personal lesson of having find my voice in the silence. The colors have mixed and merged, and it looked pretty bad and worn out. The more meaningful, since justice and fairness is a long battle that can worn out the best of the warriors. Besides, nothing is white or black, or red or pink in this case. The mix was the representation of the incredible complexities of life. I gave it to you. You disdain it. Then, burn it in front of me. Well, I tried not to over-react. I swallowed my metaphors giving you the possibility of doing whatever you wanted with my present. I surrendered once more to the experience. We all watched it burn. You took the ashes and put them on my forehead and on my cheekbones. Similarly, as you had done in the mountain with the dust, and then in the road with the blackberries. A Shiva warrior, with my third eye opened, ready to destruct the world once again to make it reborn. You were horny, you wanted to have sex, and I was always up for some fun on the bushes. It was a bad location. K. and Mar. gave us an hour of intimacy that we spend looking at animals on cages, cleaning up ourselves on the toilets of the bowling bar, and making jokes about teenagers. You shared a bit more of your past, your relationship with your father, and your origins as a suffering teenager. I kept on proposing spots of consuming our love once more. K. and Mar. were waiting for us. We met. We went towards the couchsurfer house. I fixed your backpack. It was funny to transform you into a modern lady, you, that I had seen you photographing dead insects, and chewing sticks from the ground. You that were for me as much of an animal as I consider myself. We both surrender to the path. We both walked quite silently, being led by K.. We arrived nowhere and there we also find each other. We kissed, we record our love and affection. There was no couchsurfer, no keys, no house. I didn’t look for the keys. I was tired, and I didn’t care much about what was going on or what was going to happened. I supported K. who was probably the most stressed one at the moment. We went to the McDonalds before heading to the center. I started losing my patience with Mar. when she said that she was hungry. I mean, there are moments and moment. It wasn’t me the one that was homeless at 10pm in an unknown city. It wasn’t me the one that couldn’t stand a night outside. It wasn’t me the one whose gender is considered as weak and vulnerable. And still, her sight was so short that she couldn’t see beyond her stomach. K. talked with El., we headed to the center, where there were the people, as in the Stephen King’s novel: The running man. We took the tram. Love each other a bit more there. Eventually, arriving to the lights show of the cathedral. We ate some food before it started, and then hug each other. I felt so good, so deeply rewarded, so complete, so fulfilled. I was travelling next to a wonderful soul, an incredibly beautiful Russian-Estonian girl that was intelligent, funny, artistic, sensitive, emotionally mature, resourceful, spontaneous, atypical and unconventional, extraordinary… I was enjoyed a performance next to someone I could share my life with. It felt like achieving a life goal. It didn’t matter whether it was going to last for 15 minutes or 15 years. It was real, it was happening, and no one could take me the feeling away. I kissed you, I hugged you, I loved you, I enjoyed the showed, but infinitely more, I enjoyed the moment with you. The show finished. I shared my thoughts and feelings with you. We lied together on the net. We shared our breaths, nose to nose, and mouth to mouth. We saw our souls on each other eyes. You told me that you felt safe with me. I told you that that was probably the biggest compliment you could ever give me. The compliment about ruling the world together had felt amazing, but that one meant a transformation on your being. There was no more distance, no more attempts of getting annoyed. You had accepted that I was there for you, that I was there to protect you, that I had surrendered to you. That I was independent to let you go at any moment, and at the same time I could spend my life with yours. I felt our love maturing at the speed of light. Mar. appeared. But the rules had changed. I wasn’t any more on the hostel, or on your room. I was on the street, I was fee, and I was planning to give you tons of public affection there and wherever we were. Somehow Mar. disappeared as well. I hugged you while the next show was going on. I just wanted to rest next to you, that was all I wanted, all I had looked for since our walk up the mountain. Finally, I could have it. That was my prize, my reward. I had fought so much, suffered so much, enduring so much pain, so much rejection, so much lack of trust, so many games, so many plays… I had been called manipulator, that I wanted to confront people and to put some against others. I had received tons of shit just for trying to improve everyone’s lives. Somehow you had always been there next to me, making my existence easy sometimes, and hard and challenging other times, but always caring directly or indirectly for me. There on the net, I had your love, support, trust for another last time. I surrender to you, I gave you my being, and you hold it and cared for it. I woke up. I kissed you. I hugged you. I shared my feelings with you. You shared yours with me. We fell in love to each other in a healthy way, knowing that we were going to separate in less than an hour. I told you that your love was excellent and that the quality of what you were doing for the world was fantastic. The clock ticked and we had to move fast. I carried your bag, and we arrived on time to the bus stop just for sharing our last feelings. I kissed you. You kissed me. We kissed each other. I loved you. You loved me. We loved each other. It was the end of the journey, the end of the adventure, the end of the trip, the end of the story, and it was a fucking happy ending. I was so happy. I was so exhilaratingly happy for having meeting you. I had already confessed that for someone like you the horny asshole that I was could turn into a monogamic male. You had shown me that you had all I was looking for in a partner and probably many things more that I hadn’t discovered yet. You had made me grow so much, and we had share so much our intimacy, that fucking yes, I loved you. You had broken my wheel of reincarnation. I envisioned us creating together, travelling together, growing together, living together, evolving together. I envisioned us ruling the world together. We were separating for an unknown period of time and still there wasn’t the minimum glimpse of sadness or negative emotion. I had surrender to life, I would let life developed and see if I could find a moment to facilitate our future encounter. I kept on smiling, on holding your hair as I had done in the mountain, on admiring the beauty of your eyes and your smile. On knowing that I was letting your leave with the highest joy and peace on my heart. I thank the universe a dozen of times for having meeting you, for having brought our lives together, for letting me know that you existed. I kissed you, hugged you. You kissed me, hugged me. It felt so intense. We hugged each other with tons of intensity, as I hadn’t done since years. But only with joy and hope from my side. No pain, no suffering. That was love. That was unattached loved. That was mature and healthy love. I loved you so much, I felt myself growing and expanding with each breath. I kept on giving you my whole self, my whole being. I enjoyed the goodbye as I had never done. I walked towards the bus looking at you. Before getting up our gazes crossed for a last time. I entered the bus, looked for a place to sleep. Found it, lie down thanking the size of my body, and collapse almost completely until arriving to Brussels. The trip was over. 1.11 Day… (DAY 11 – 2019-08-05) I spend the day doing the garden, sleeping and procrastinating my duties. I let my body recover from such a journey and evolution. 1.12 …after… (DAY 12 – 2019-08-06) I postpone my life, my duties and start writing. 1.13 …day (DAY 13 – 2019-08-07) After two days of almost uninterrupted writing, I am here. I have some notes to add, but I think that for the moment, I will leave the text as it is. 40 pages of learning and lessons written in 2 days and experienced in 10. 1.14 Reviewing (Day 14 – 2019-08-11) It has been a week, and it seems an eternity. It seems already so far away and so alien to me. I have spent most of my day reviewing and correcting the text in this bus that is taking me to Vienna, to the next episode of my life. Living is weird, writing is weird, evolving and growing is weird. I am here now, still thanking you for all the things you have done. I hope you have enjoyed reading my experience, and I will be very happy to receive and read yours. Infinite thanks A. for having become part of my life. Infinite love and protection to you, Carlito Fluito A good timed withdrawal is a victory.↩ Click on the image to see the video.↩ "],

Here there are some of our messages exchanged through Facebook together with some of my inner processes along this period. I never send it to you. Until now. Preamble I was raising downwards. You were gestating inside my mind. A sheep in lion’s clothing venturing into the den of a lion in sheep’s clothing. 2.1 Silence (2019-08-05 to 2019-09-07) 2.1.1 The letter (2019-08-05 to 2019-08-13) I was in Brussels. I wasn’t worrying much about you, since I knew you would get away of pretty much any situation, but I was curious about what had happened. — How was the night? — The night was great. How was your travel? — Sleeping a lot, like what I am doing today. Planning to write something to you soon. How the night developed? Anecdote? — The kind guy found me and brought me to his place, woke up Maritrini, she was quite unhappy. The night developed good. 😁 Right after you left, I got high. Ate a vegetarian tortilla in the morning. Got some insightful thoughts on detachment of one’s own feelings. I didn’t fully get what you meant by “kind guy” or the rest of the anecdote until three months later, when, considering the new situation, by chance I asked the “kind guy” about you. Anyways, I was pleased you kept communicating and being honest with me. — Wonderful. I have trust on you and your resources. You won’t fall from the tree; you’ll be okay surviving one random night on Strasbourg. 🙂 Remember that you have my help (no matter it’s quality) if you feel low. I’ll write to put some of my thoughts in order and share them with you (don’t expect the most elaborated text…). I send you some love. ❤️ — 🥰 😘 That same night I texted you. — This one is yours? Also, share your pics on the album, please The more personal ones, you can share them by email or Dropbox/whatever Thanks!!! I kept on writing your letter. The next day (2019-08-06) I messaged you: — I hope you have some free time to read my thoughts Your email address? The more personal ones, you can share them by email or Dropbox/whatever Thanks!!! You wrote your email address. — The notes are not mine, I believe those are from Ines I will manage the pictures and everything else in few days, I need some sleep 😀 And the next day (2019-08-07): — I am pretty done with the writing. I don’t know if you are planning to write or share your writing with me. In case you do, I wouldn’t like to interfere your memory and interpretation of the experience with my words and thoughts In case you don’t plane to write and share anything with me, I can send you my text — I would like to read it, I have my notes, don’t worry 😊 I was advancing with the text. It was long, but worthwhile (2019-08-11) — Almost finished 💪 💪 💪 40 pages… Read them slowly. — Oh wow — Also, I’m thinking about visiting Estonia. It could be cool to see your face on cinema. But don’t feel obliged. If you don’t want my visit, let me know. And in case of going, it could be nice to stay at your place (Tallinn or otherwise) 27.500 words Voilà, it’s on your mail Enjoy it Two days of silence. It was 2019-08-13. I wasn’t worrying much. I was in Vienna with a friend. I had sent you forty pages of letter to read. That take time to answer. You made an appearance. — I’ve read 2 chapters and wow how little u know/understand/understood me.. that’s so interesting. I decided to read one chapter a day to lengthen the joy of sweet memories 😃 — I think I’d be happy to see you here, I won’t be able to host you tho in Tallinn cuz I’m giving the room away in the end of August and I don’t know how busy I’ll be with all the school and movie shit so I can’t be sure how much time I could chill with you but if u are coming anyways I’ll be happy to see you You comment about my lack of understanding hurt and confused me a bit. Anyways, you seemed happy with the letter. That was enough for me. — It will help understanding you, if you share your notes/ thoughts 🙂 About going, it can be helpful to know your plans and visit when you are more free Then, silence. 2.1.2 Writing letters around Europe (2019-08-14 to 2019-09-03) My days were busy. I was satisfied because I had been able to finish the letter. I was enjoying myself in Vienna with my friend. Well, kinda. Actually, I was continuously comparing how intense and alive I have felt being with you; how smart, wise and knowledgeable you were; how much you have challenged me; and how little of that my friend was giving to me. After spending the day with my friend, I wanted to do something that inspired me intellectually. I needed to write out and clear up my mind. I wanted to write you, but a second letter before the last one would have been way too much. Since I didn’t know who to write, I felt like writing J., a girl I had met at a party at the beginning of the summer and whom I had spent an evening in a park few days ago, getting to know each other, and eventually kissing on the grass. However, after your mention of “How little I had understood you”. I was pretty sure I wasn’t going to send her the letter. At least, not in the near future. Letter to J. (2019-08-14) 00.01 (Just for the coincidences) Hello J., You may not read this until I publish it. Maybe you read it when I send it to you. Or maybe you never read it. In any case, I want to write it and that’s why I do it. I was thinking today about the idea of writing and how when I share my experience of an event or situation to someone else, they have a huge advantage over me. I automatically become vulnerable because I am giving full access to my mind to someone else. I realize this soon (this morning actually) when I shared how it had been my 10 days together with a friend and she answered me that she was wowed at how little I had understood her. Well, that is the thing. I haven’t been in anyone else’s mind or head in my life other than mine. Thus, I can only live and experience life from my perspective and based on my experience. On the other hand, writing is this amazing tool that allows us to go into other people’s mind, at least the part that they are willing to share with us, and discover how other people think and experience the world. That is the huge beauty of reading. Reading is, after all, the ultimate enactment of voyeurism. To get into someone’s head. And, it is interesting how the writer exposes itself to an endless number of voyeurs. However, I was pondering a reversed thought that I had some time ago about how writing is ultimately a tool to get inside other’s people minds. Writing, and being read, is to get into the deepest intimacy of the people that read. It is even worse, it is becoming part of them, part of their mind, part of their reality, part of their experience of life. I remember I saw a video that explained that the advantage of reading authors like Proust or Joyce was that they were teaching how to observe reality from new perspectives, like if we were using Proust lenses, or Joyce lenses. Thus, the exchange seems to me somehow valuable, somehow worthwhile. The author is fully aware of its vulnerability by exposing itself to the reader, but the readers, many times are unaware of how the author is getting into their minds, into their beings. I also like the comment made by Peterson quoting Jung: “People don’t have ideas. Ideas have people.” Therefore, when a writer is consciously and willingly putting ideas into people, he is possessing part of the people that dare to read them. He is entering, inhabiting, and incubating inside people’s existence and consciousness. That is the danger of reading, to let other people entering your mind; and thus, the power of writing, to become part of people’s mind. It results pretty curious to me this bi-directional transaction, this exchange. The curious voyeurism in exchange of the vulnerability of your consciousness. It makes me question whether it is worthwhile the sacrifice of one’s mind, and in case it is, when and whit whom it is worth the sacrifice. Probably, when writing was invented, with the mere purpose of counting and keeping track of grain and goods, people weren’t realizing the huge psychological weapon that they were creating. Playing a bit spiritual and mystic, I assume that all this problem of which ideas are getting in which mind comes with the attachment to the ego and the self that is so prevalent in western culture. Recently, speaking with the same friend that mentioned her surprise at realizing that I had understood so little about her, she mentioned that a conversation or a walk could change the way I was. I told her that I wasn’t really afraid of changing who I was and that this was actually a good thing. During my Vipassana experience, I got in touch with something that can be called detachment from the self, or selfless state. It didn’t feel really good at that moment, and I got scared. I opened my eyes and came back to my senses, to the daily reality. Actually, it felt pretty scary to abandon any idea I had about “Carlos”, about myself. At that moment, it felt as if “Carlos” was going to disappear forever to give way to something else that I completely unknew. Although I couldn’t do it at that moment, since then, I have grown a much healthier relationship with my ego, or that is what I like to think. In the example of the conversation with my friend, I told her that I was always up to update my current version of myself to a new one, to something better, to something that is working and behaving in better way within this world. It requires a big dose of courage, but more than courage, I would consider it as detachment. It requires a huge dose of detachment. The other thing I have noticed is that sometimes is difficult to keep track of my changes and how quickly I am switching previous versions of myself. For example, it is a bit difficult to remember which version of myself you met at the party and compare it with the version of myself that I am today. You know, I like to think that the more versions of myself, the better. Especially considering that you liked the version of myself that you met the other day. I would like to imagine that the self is an accumulative process, instead of a renewable one. We can already agree that it is a fluid process, that the self is not fixed; but I am thinking that is actually a renewable one. Although I am not completely sure. It is clear that we are not the selves that we were used to be when we were kids, but I am not sure whether the self that we were when we were kids is still hidden somewhere in a corner of our minds. I mean, it probably is, which would mean that the self is accumulative, and although it has renewed, it hasn’t completely erased previous versions of itself. Anyway, don’t take myself to seriously, after all, it is 00.33 and synchronicities is a concept that neither me, nor science has completely understood. The only thing I know is that I would love to spend more time with you, and I would love to go to concerts with you. Today, I saw one in the city hall of Vienna of a couple of comedians/musicians that I would love to re-watch with you, so you can explain me many of the musical references that I didn’t understand, which are most of them. Also, I imagine myself reading at your place while you “study” with the cello, which for me would be like being in a concert while I am reading. Also, I am imagining myself developing my dance performance next to your musical improvisation, which would be extremely interesting for me. And while imagining this things, I keep on reminding myself that we have met each other only two times, and although, we have like each other in both of them, or at least our laughs reflected so, we have just kissed in one, the one we were less drunk. Thus, I cannot send you this letter today because you could interpret my words, dreams, and imagination as neediness, and there are few things as unattractive as neediness. It is this sad, but this is the game we have to play in this society at this point of history. The game of disguising love, so it is not confused with neediness. Or maybe, who knows, I am needy. I am needy of a person that puts some art and beauty in my life. V. left. A., who knows if she is gone. And you, you play the cello. Lucky me, I can write and talk with you today, and lucky me that I can control and choose whether you read it or not, whether you hear me or not. Lucky me that I can put my thoughts outside of my mind, and maybe, and probably inside of yours, but simply, not tonight. Thanks for reading, whenever you are doing it, and whoever you are. Have a good night, with a few of my thoughts in your mind, and a part of myself in yours. That happens when you practice voyeurism with the person you shouldn’t. The second day in Vienna, during the Free Walking Tour, I started to have negative thoughts and ideas. I felt disconnected from the rest of the tourist. I felt disconnected with the people around the city. I felt disconnected with the moment. I didn’t want to be there, I didn’t want to do what I was doing. I felt stupid there, like wasting my time. I didn’t like people… Actually, the most interesting things that happened was to observe a confused bee that was struggling to move around the tourist. I was wishing none of them would step on it, since it could barely fly and she was moving clumsily at our ankles level. Little by little, I was able to move it towards a tree that was next to St. Stephen Cathedral. Even that tree looked sad and miserable, locked around concrete, next to a huge pile of stones. I took notes on my phone about the feelings I was having, thinking that I wanted to send them to you. You that were so verse in these dark parts of existence, in these obscure wells of negativity. You could help me explore those depths that I had repressed for so long. You had indeed dig enough to bring some of these ideas to the surface. I was unlocking my shadow, thanks to the time spent together. That was something new in me. Something that I had to work on, and who was better than you to work on it? But I didn’t want to make you feel utilized by me. So I had to think about someone else. Who would like to receive the darkest part of my being? Who other than you, that was so experienced on psychological suffering? I thought about In., from the exchange. She has been the girl that had made me cry with her farewell. I am a person with difficulties for crying, for releasing my emotions through my tears, but it has been deeply liberating to cry at her room. She was a person wise and comprehensive enough to receive my pain. I kept on taking notes during the next days, and later on, when I found time, after my trip and once in Brussels, I wrote the letter. The trip continued as planned. I visited Ljubljana (Slovenia), and then, Trieste (Croatia). In both countries I met my friends, wonderful beings all of them, and also a new person came to my life. They all showed me how much I still have to learn, and how much I was already ready to give. I speak with them about you. They made some comments, but they trust on me, and my ability to take decision.I kept myself busy spending time with them while you were reading my text. Hopefully, you would answer with your words at some point. I wasn’t expecting a long letter like mine since I was already used to it. Many of my past letters to other friends have been left unanswered. Specially the long ones. But anyways, I was eager to hear from you, to know your feedback. I talked with K., your best friend, a few days later (2019-08-17). I asked her for the pictures of the exchange. Two days later (2019-08-19) just when I arrived back to Brussels from Croatia, I found K.’s message. Without any warm up, she hit back. — What is the meaning of life? — A bit of a difficult question for FB chat Why do you ask? Btw, I’m fan of writing letters, if you write me one with the question and context, I can write my answer After 3 days of K.’s silence (2019-08-22), I sent her the link of my “Meaning of life” video from YouTube. She just reacted to the message with a thumb up. — How are your existential questions going? — Perfect She wasn’t specially talkative. — Great Are you posting the pictures in the folder? K. became silent as well. She wasn’t uploading the pictures to the folder either. I wanted to see ourselves kissing during the last day. I wanted to refresh my memory with the images of the exchange. I wanted to conserve the pictures for the future. But it wasn’t happening. I was in Brussels, feeling lonely from time to time, like always. Anyways, I didn’t want to show myself vulnerable, or to needy or demanding for you. I was waiting for your answer, which wasn’t arriving. However, nine days after your last message (2019-08-22), I thought I had been waiting enough and I decided to text you. — How are you doing? But nothing happened. One day later, I decided to take a look to the notes I had collected in Vienna, and I wrote a letter out of them. Letter to In. (2019-08-23) 18.38 Brussels, Mortimer is drinking Hello In., I don’t like human beings. A bit of a disclaimer first. I use my bad days to write to other people, like you, but I am quite aware that I am mostly writing to myself. Hello Carlos, However, you are my reader. Or at least, the person that I am supposedly writing this letter to. Thus, at least, the honor of writing your name at the top, next to the date, the time, and the place where I am in. The second disclaimer is not to take very seriously what I am writing. I am also pretty aware that emotional states are transitory, and I have gotten pretty good with time at not having more than two bad days in a row, and most of the time, these days reflect things that I have or have not done that impact directly or indirectly to my wellbeing. For example, I have showered the last four days with warm water; I am following a new diet that may be affecting my mood as well. I am trying the 80/10/10 raw vegan diet based mostly on eating large amounts of fruits. The main reason is going minimalistic in the kitchen/life and increasing the environmental sustainability of my existence, although I am not fully convinced of the second. Besides, I keep on procrastinating a pile of things that should be done or that I should be doing; and I have been avoidant of some of my well-being practices, like exercising, meditation, listening to hypnosis, following some online courses and others. In the negative aspects, I am sleeping more than usual, partly because of the diet; and last night I slept on the bed, instead of on the floor, which I have to admit that it has been indeed beneficial (at least, just for one night). Also, today my landlord kind of threatened to expel me from the place where I am living because I haven’t arranged the patio since I arrived on Tuesday. Today is Friday, but the deadheading of the daffodils should be done two to three times per week. We are different people and each of us has their own peculiarities… 3 As you can notice, I am not following a very typical life. I am not sure either what is the right thing to do. I was feeling lonely on Wednesday evening, but I was too tired to try anything social. Yesterday, Thursday, I met a friend and we went to Luxembourg square, a place for public drinking. I get easily bored and I find the people there quite non-inspirational. Today, I just come from meeting a friend that is vegetarian but said that my attempt at fruitarianism is extremism. She said, “Don’t be a Nazi.” Well, Nazis killed people, and I am eating fruits partially to avoid killing trees. I think that there is a small difference. I think that extremism is quite the opposite, which is the meat and dairy industry. But let’s avoid such an easy topic. Although, I was listening to the debate “Animals should be off the menu” today. The 10 minutes argumentation of Phillip Wollen is quite a phenomenon on social media, and if you haven’t watched it, well, you may. The turning point during the evening was when I saw a dog whining to another dog while he was pulling from the leash to try to get to the other dog. At that moment, the thought came to my mind “I don’t like human beings. Fucking primates.” That reminded me of all the notes I took while walking around Vienna a bit more than a week ago, and how I already thought about writing to you to share this darker part of my being with someone as socially intelligent as you are. Also, now, while writing, the episode of Nietzsche protecting a horse that was being beaten came to my mind. A genius sent to an asylum for a public demonstration of compassion. You see, we are supposedly getting better but environmental, and human rights activists are still arrested by the police. We are getting there. Let me take my notes from Vienna. NOTES FROM VIENNA I have a lot of hate inside There in Vienna, the realization was a bit deeper and darker. Here, I opened the letter saying that I don’t like human beings, but there I wrote that I hate them. Actually, I realized that I have a lot of hate inside. As a wannabe, spiritual leader, recognizing and assuming this may seem a contradiction, but to me, it just indicates to me that I am on the right path of self-discovery to healing and towards a future more focused reorientation of my efforts toward others. So, yes, I have a lot of hate inside. It was there, accessible and controlling, back in the days of 2014, where I was living in Leuven (Belgium). I cannot say this often, but this part of my life is already public and published, you can check it on the website. Thanks to the invaluable advice of my former philosophy teacher, my master and mentor throughout the years, I was able to move away from existentialism, Bukowski, and the heavy thoughts that were infecting my mind. I oriented my attention into the optimism of Russel, Mozart, and by chances of life, the Tao Te Ching. Anyways, I am not there now, not even close. I am on a much more stable and fulfilling path, knowing where I am going (kind of), and keeping the progress. I assume that it has been these four days of accumulated procrastination what is affecting me. Is it normal to empathize more with animals than with people? There in Vienna, I was observing a confused bee, walking randomly on the street, trying to find its way. It was actually during the stop at Stephansplatz, where the guide, Wolfgang, was speaking about the church when I saw that poor bee. There in the square, I had given my water and some figs and dates to an old woman and her husband the day before. How could I have not? I was surprised that under the sun and the number of people on the square they were so grateful to me for doing it, and how no one else had collected a tiny bit of their empathy and compassion to help some fellow sapiens. As you see, this is one of my problems, I focus on seeing others’ faults instead of seeing what I do right. But I keep on doing it right anyway. And hopefully, they will stop doing it wrong. Right and wrong… Those things that only moralizers like me dare to say, but when speaking about compassion, for a weaker and more vulnerable sapiens, they are difficult to deny. I was worrying for the bee because it seemed to me that anyone could step on it at any moment, and I wouldn’t like to witness that. Thus, as soon as Wolfgang stopped talking and moved towards the next stop, I took the bee on my phone and put it under a tree where who knows what its future would be. The fundamental question that I made to myself at that moment was: Is it normal to empathize more with animals than with people? I could answer that question to myself later that week when I saw myself reflected on a vegetarian friend that was complaining about how irresponsible their friends were for not taking care of their own lives. My friend, B., was really angry. He mentioned the case of one of his friends that was lying by telling him that he was making progress with their own master thesis when indeed he was not. Why lying to a friend that is trying to help you? Why lying to yourself so openly? I told B. to be compassionate, to be empathetic, to understand the development of each human being, to be patient. Those things that I preach and learn during the exchange. (Actually, you don’t know how my story developed on the exchange… You’d love to read about it once it is published 😉). I told B. that the construct of free-will in sapiens makes us, fellow sapiens, to consider individuals responsible for their successes and their disgraces, responsible for the outcome of their actions. That is why, from my point of view, it is way easier to empathize with a poor bee, or all the victims of the meat industry holocaust, than with a sapiens that doesn’t study for the exam, or that keeps on consuming meat while being aware of its environmental and suffering impacts. Awareness, like reason, like consciousness, like freedom, as Fromm defended, brings consequences, brings burdens, brings responsibility. If a sapiens, who is supposedly aware of the impact of its actions wants to remain coherent of its behavior, it better behaves properly, because if not, it will be 1) immoral, and 2) object to the reprimands of its fellow sapiens. (Speaking about sapiens calling us sapiens, and using the “it” pronoun is actually helping me to make my point a bit clear while reminding gender neutrality because, you know, 2019…) The thing is, if we take out free-will, and become more tolerant and patient of other’s sapiens development, we may reduce ourselves to unconscious animals that are merely led by circumstances, genes, and impulses. I was there once in the past (also in Leuven 2014) realizing how liberating was to call myself a product of all my previous experiences, and taking out all the burdens of my past and present by claiming that I was nothing but a product of what I have experienced and lived. But, the downside of this view is that many people would take it as paternalizing, and with tones of superiority (and you know the general opinion about patriarchy nowadays, 2019, you know…). I wouldn’t mind being more tolerant, patient, empathetic, and even helpful with sapiens as long as they would assume that they are not more than a dog that is learning a trick and it is taking a bit more time to understand it than a normal dog. But I fear that the general opinion about this comment would materialize in an infuriated mass offended by my comparison to them with animals. Well, either I treat you as a dog and I express my understanding at your slow development and learning, or you better become aware and conscious of how your actions are affecting other beings’ wellbeing, and you start doing what we both know is right to do. So please, In., help me with this dilemma. Should I empathize with my fellow unaware sapiens like I do with bees, and dogs? Or should I blame them for their lack of responsibility towards the consequences of their actions? Can I do the first without being patronizing and seeming superior? Can I do the second without receiving defensive comments and weak argumentations about free will and how each person is free to do whatever they want? “I am not forcing you to eat meat. Don’t force me to not eat it.” Are anger and hate a manifestation of fear? The so-common spiritual bi-polarity of fear vs. love also affects me when I think about these things. Supposedly, every action, intention, thought, emotion, reaction can be a sub-product and a manifestation of either love or hate. Well, who knows? Maybe it’s true. Thus, I was thinking, if anger and hate are not easily identifiable with love, they have to be fear. But it is difficult for me to make the link. Anger can be fear of a certain type of injustice applied in oneself, and then, seeing one’s existence threaten, provoke the fear response that could manifest with anger. For example, if I get angry at sapiens not realizing that the life of a being, whatever its species and quality, shouldn’t be killed by hedonistic purposes, maybe, deeper in my being, I am afraid that these same sapiens could turn violently on me as a source of satisfying their hedonistic purposes with a detrimental effect on my wellbeing, or even my life. However, hate is a bit deeper and obscure. Hate is close to disgust; it’s close to avoidance. But at the same time, it can be close to a violent approach. I remember that quote of Hitler in his “Mein Kampf”: “I can fight only for something that I love. I can love only what I respect. And in order to respect a thing, I must at least have some knowledge of it.*” Therefore, hate, as opposed to love, is a lack of interest, lack of knowledge, lack of respect. That is why it is easier to hate things that we don’t know, things we prefer to be distanced with. Feelings like universal connection, the unifying quality of a spiritual experience, are so linked with love and the dissipation of fear and anger. When we start seeing all as once, we stop hating, we stop being angry, we stop fear. Anyway, in my case, I may hate humans because, as it happens with anger, I may fear that they become against me as individual as it has happened in the past so many times… Niemoöller stated this in his famous “First they came…” Also, one quote I wrote after my incident with the Belgian facilitator, Et., was: “I wish I could be extremely intolerant with violence, but violent people don’t tolerate this type of extremism.” So yes, as it seems, hate is another manifestation of fear. My deeply and rooted fear of not only my end as an individual, the fear of death that is so connected with the experience of being alive and which I am still attached to but also the disappearance of sapiens as a species and all those that may die with us, besides all the suffering generated on the process. I almost write “the disappearance of life on earth”, the only known place on the universe with life until date, but I easily remember that the Earth will hear from us as we heal from a bad flu. The conditions and characteristics of the Earth and the temporal dimensions of this universe make human existence and human impact shrink when considering astronomical measures. Thus, I am not scared of the disappearance of life on the planet, but I am pretty worried about the suffering that we can cause in our species and the rest forms of sentient life. So yes, some fear is present over there. I see life as a competition. Another really intelligent comment you made that night we spent at the porch of the hostel was that instead of making my interactions with people as a zero-sum game, as a competition, I could reframe them as cooperation, as a non-zero-sum game. For example, today a friend sent an initiative about posting a picture of your pet tagging Royal Canine and Scouts Spain to promote donations towards animals in refugees. Well, I asked him if he was vegan or not. He mentioned that he consumes local animal products. Before blaming, I congratulated him for his efforts but it was somehow unavoidable mentioning that he is only financing the killing of “local animals”, which is not that bad, but… Later on, during the day, I realized that I could reframe the situation as if we were together fighting for the same cause. I just have to accept that there are some fighters that are better than others (although since I cannot say “better”, more efficient, more impactful, more quarrelsome). I wrote it some years ago, “ We are fighting the war of peace” So the best warriors are those that make less harm. But as you can see in my metaphor, it is all a competition. Not only a competition like the two sides of the battle but a competition between warriors from the same side to check who is the best. Maybe, I should start reframing the competition in an “us vs. them”, and this way, at least, I would reduce the competition I have towards the people on my own side. And who knows if, at the end, I will realize that “we are all on the same side and that we are just doing our best living the life we have.” But yes, I guess I should repeat this as a mantra every day. (I just add it to the daily affirmations.) I will work on it. Am I selfish? Well, I think so. Indeed, yesterday (2019-08-23, now is 2019-08-24; 10.13) I was talking with a friend and I realized that I am fucking selfish. She was telling me how the last exchange where she participated has changed her life and some of the lessons that she has learned from it. At some point, I had the impulse to start talking about my experience, what I have learned and how I have growth. However, thanks to having written to you the idea about being compassionate with superiority, I remembered that she is younger than me (21, I think), and I let her talk as much as she wanted. I even started asking “Something else?” when she stopped. I think it was really good for her to feel listened and not judged about her process of development. I remember how, when I was at her stage of development, years ago, I used to have a friend, Laura, that was eight years older than me. Laura used to give me advice about life and love, but somehow, she destroyed part of what I was discovering, and made me doubt about the truths I was encountering on my way. L. is still today one of those ambiguous figures of my past that I haven’t fully interiorized, forgave, or understood. I didn’t want to be my friend’s “L.”, so I remained silent and non-judgmental. However, since we went to my place to sleep, my lovely ironical and critical Carlos took control of the situation and started making all types of comments, from calling black people: “black. Oh no, sorry! Human beings with high levels of melatonin in their skin”; to speak about sex and virginity from a “phallocentric perspective”, because, you know, 2019… I ended up mentioning things like “*If you see yourself too cute in the mirror, no worries, it’s because it’s my mirror. That is why I am such a conceited guy.” Followed by “Magic Mirror in my hand, who is the fairest in the land?”4 because, you know, Walt Disney did its job brainwashing my generation selecting which values are considered feminine and how girls should be after them. Since I couldn’t stop, I was mentioning my keenness to eat sushi from the trash and how I would have loved to be a fish living in the ocean to be fished, killed, processed, packaged, transported, cooked, packaged again, and, eventually, thrown in a bag to the container. Well, at least, I took it. If M., my friend, sends me the picture, I will forward it to you, just so you can update what eating from the trash means. So, yes, after that, I even had to comment how the dog thanks to whom I am living in this studio is likely living better than more than 50% of the sapiens of this planet. He has four meals a day; a private house for himself, and a shared one; two sapiens taking care of him, one of them, me, has the denomination of “dog-sitter”, the other one is the “owner”. Since he is already 16, way beyond average life expectancy of fox terriers, the visits to the vet have increased lately to, I am guessing, twice a month; thus, a private doctor to do check-ins every two weeks. Besides, he is taking four different pills (that is the reason he is eating so many times) to control his arrhythmias, and intestinal problems (his diet switched to a low-fat type of croquettes about six months ago). And well, if loneliness is a problem for the lucky European elderly, not for him, since that is the main reason I am here. He spends most of the day as an alive dog of his age would do, sleeping, walking up and down the house, and smelling stuff around. I don’t want to bring numbers to the table about undernourished and famished sapiens, or about climate change refugees, or about wars refugees and death tolls, or about currency inequality, or about the highest one percent having more than the lowest fifty per cent, or about social care system in the US, or about access to drinkable water, or about, or about, or about… You know, 2019. Maria asked me: “ — Do you think that this dog would still be alive if he wouldn’t be taking the pills? — Absolutely not. This dog is a miracle of western science. — *And don’t you think it is a bit unfair to keep him alive?” — Well, I am no one to judge. I am just describing the situation. I let judgments for other people. Future, if any, will judge us. M. went to the bathroom and I kept on thinking about the planet. Maybe in the future people like Bolsonaro have to pay for what he is doing to the Amazonas. I like terms like “Crimes against humanity”. I think they are very suitable in these situations. Maybe it is me, the one that ends up paying in the short term with social rejection, as is happening, for bringing moral issues to the conversation table. “Please, let us eat at peace.” Yes, peace. Peace is a wonderful value as well. I was reluctant this morning to kill the mosquito that woke us up. You know, let it live, let it breath. M. wanted to have sex. I didn’t. I tried to explain to her how to arouse a guy that is not excited. She is young and impatient. She couldn’t listen, understand and accept. She told me that I wasn’t cooperating. I answered: — I am telling you the solution. This is what happens to me with humanity all the time. I tell them the solution. They do what they want. And I just asked them to leave me alone if they don’t want to listen.” Because I was starting to feel a bit guilty like every time I was directly increasing the suffering of another being, I told her: — This is how life works. Many ignorants vote an asshole that sells a piece of the planet to a bunch of heartless in exchange for some paper that is used to buy things.5 But you have posted a video about it, M.; and that is already more than what I have done. I had tears in my eyes when I added this last sentence. Depending on how much she wants to admit, thanks to my influence, or not, she has switched from omnivore to vegan, and moved to a more zero-waste life along the last year we have known each other. When I met her for the first time, in September of 2018, she had liquid soap in the shower. Now, it is solid. It seems to me that the most effective way to influence women in their ecological behavior is through sex. Anyway, she is a great human being doing great things for humankind, and I hope she keeps on doing them. Eventually, I added: — Affirmations, M., affirmations. To not forget about it. To not forget who you are, and what you are doing. And I repeated to myself the first affirmation of my list: “I am alive. I am breathing. I love breathing.”6 So, yes, a pretty good-intentioned asshole. That is what I am. If I am selfish or not, I don’t know. Maybe. I like to think of myself as a pretty non-selfish person, but who knows. Maybe I am one of the most. Guiltiness and suffering As I have mentioned, when I realize how my behavior, attitudes, emotions, words, and thoughts are increasing the suffering of other beings, I feel guilty. I came up with this idea while being in Vienna. I was with my friend Br., who is also quite young (20) and has some trust difficulties manifested in different degrees of social anxiety. Poor Br. is from Romania, I met her in a Youth Exchange a couple of years ago and she is the one posting on my social media. I met her in Austria with the idea of seeing each other after a long time (more than a year of attempts) and to reinforce her for working with me (I paid for most of the things of the trip). Also, just so I am not avoiding a meaningful part of the story, I am sexually attracted to her: she is cute, blond, young, and well-proportioned (you know, sapiens male brain). We already kissed on the past, and she expressed her erotic intentions towards me at some point. Anyway, along the days we were together, I developed a strong impatience towards her. So many basic things that she didn’t know how to do, or how to apply… I told her from the beginning that I was very impatient, but she kept on complimenting me for my patience with her. I am really sorry for the type of people she has encountered in the past to consider me as patient. That is a good example of how different our inner lives are experienced from what other people are perceiving. Inner suffering, you know. Br. has a certain level of dependence to caffeine. She mentioned that she had low-blood pressure and that coffee was good for her health, especially when she had the period, as it happened in Vienna (do you see it coming already?). The free tour on which we were participating made the break for resting in a hotel, and although I am quite anti-consumerist, Br. decided to take a coffee there. I wasn’t going to moralize more than what I was doing already, so I went to the bar with her just to observe. As a Romanian student, you can quickly imagine how much of an economical impact one coffee in the bar of a hotel of the center of Vienna does. I was paying for the Airbnb and food for both, but not for what I considered expendable expenses. She took her purse and started collecting copper coins. It reminded me so much of my old days that I couldn’t feel anything other than warmth in my chest. I liked so much her initiative of getting rid of all that extra weight that I was very committed to helping her count them. However, she got nervous and self-conscious, and told me to leave her, just to take the two-euro coin and pay with that and some 50 cents. I tried to rationalize with her and tell her that money is money and it doesn’t matter. But her social anxiety started to kick in. She got shaky hands, unstoppable thoughts, and uncontrollable emotions. She kinda got annoyed with me, and I got annoyed with her. I left the hotel, turned to my phone, and laughed and moralized (another vegan discussion) at what my friends around the world were messaging to me. Later on, I felt guilty for having screwed up Br.’s expensive treat. I am so aware of how interfering for the digestive processes is to ingest foods with an activated sympathetic nervous system that when I am willingly annoying someone while they are eating, I am doing it led by pure evil. Thus, I felt guilty a bit afterwards for that incident. Last year, I ended up writing a post to another Romanian girl that was driving me crazy. “Unsweetened advice” in case you are interested. She was driving me crazy, blaming me all the time for her psychological suffering. I was fending off because obviously, she had tons of inner work to do with herself, and from my point of view, she was not only ungrateful, but blaming, and her development was way too slow for my patience and the amount of time that was taking me. One of the first pieces of advice is “Stop blaming others for your psychological suffering”. I was very much applying that to keep my conscience clean each time I saw other people suffering for something I have said or done. After all, I am behaving morally right, since they are responsible for their own suffering. However, in Br.’s coffee case, I remember that physiological procedure of cortisol release and its consequences in the stomach walls. And, then, I thought that the barrier between psychological and physical suffering had been trespassed. Can you see the level of assholeness that I have as a psychologist when I start blaming myself for the psychological suffering I create only when I find the physiological links between emotions and thoughts and the physical body? Is it sexual frustration? Since I am writing my “Unfinished loves”, it made me think that part of this anger and hate towards humanity, and some of its members more specifically, that appears from time to time can be all a manifestation of my sexual frustration. This idea appeared to me in Vienna, when due to Br.’s period and menstrual pain combined with her 20 years old innocence, I was left with one of my reasons for taking a 19- hours-bus unfulfilled. The whole trip was pretty good: beautiful city, interesting history, long walks, raw food, open air funny classical music concert, history of art museum, and going up one of the Fair Ferris Wheel7 in Prater Park. However, Br.’s company was a bit frustrating. My impatience and lack of compassion towards her period and weakness; my accumulated testosterone; and the continuous instruction about what I considered basic survival, travelling, and life skills topped each other and, although I really tried to control myself, at the end I couldn’t refrain from repeating the word “Humility” about ten times once I took her smartphone and found out why she couldn’t have connected to the public wi-fi during those three days in Vienna. That humility that I so manifestly lack is what I find myself preaching to so many other people around. However, my hypotheses about the sexual frustration crumbled when the following days in Ljubiana I noticed that my friend was probably attracted to me; or in Idrija when a gay friend of my friend was explicitly attracted to me; or in Koper when some older and younger women were looking at my dance movements with something more than artistic interest; or considering the condition of my physical body in the mountains of Istria; or the evening together with a Belgian girl here back in Brussels; or the last night with M. When she was almost begging for sex while I observed her pitilessly. It doesn’t seem to me sexual frustration as much as “Connection frustration”. The gay from Idrija that I just mentioned was actually one of my more surprising connections of the trip. He is a frugivore yoga teacher living in Amsterdam, that, if life and the universe don’t give me unexpected lessons, he has become a friend for the following years. Also, in Croatia, I was visiting a friend with whom I deeply connected, in a very fruitful way. And the universe made a huge guy called Michael Gebetsroither to be seated next to me in part of my bus from Graz to Ljubiana. He really made me realize the infiniteness of my ignorance and how, how much I still have to learn. K. and N. are also wonderful souls to rejoin. Thus, those three days of connection frustration, and maybe sexual frustration as well, in Vienna transformed into beautiful connections around Slovenia and Croatia. Secondary players are N.’s boyfriend J., and B.’s girlfriend M., which are also two wonderful silent souls that I easily connect with. However, I arrived in Brussels and I came back to this place where it is so difficult to find people that actually inspire me, and that keep my motivation to push myself forward and fulfill my goals and purposes towards humanity. I do what I can, but, I can get tired sometimes as well. This morning, I broke my diet more seriously by eating some cooked sushi from yesterday’s trash. This relapse will help me empathize more with all those big people trying and failing in dieting. Sex and connection The Google Keep note where I saved these thoughts in Vienna is called “Questions for A./In.”. I don’t know who is the unluckiest of you two, since I am already in my 10th page, and it seems that I still have a couple of things more to take out of myself. I chose to send this letter to you to give some breath, space, and “distance” to A. with whom I shared 40 pages narrating my experience in the project and the role she had played on it. Last thing she texted me was something like “[…] Wow, how little you know/understand/understood me… That’s so interesting. […]” I guess that apart from my short understanding about her, by now, she would have already discovered many other things about my inner experience of being alive that she was unaware of. Anyway, I told her that she was welcome to write me back, to uncover some of my ignorance towards her, and when I mentioned visiting her in the following months, she didn’t transmit me full conviction. Last thing I messaged was a “How are you doing?” on Thursday. Today it is Saturday and there is still silence on the line. No worries. It is not about me, it is about her. Thus, I prefer to steal some of your time (Thank you very much for this), and write to you instead of her, although she could also be a good source of guidance for some of the problems that I manifest. I was extremely lucky to meet you and A. in the project. When I asked M., my friend about her project, she told me that she had connected with 10 participants out of 50. That is 20%, or 1 out of 5, which is way better than I did. In my case, T. and H. were expelled the second day, with whom I would have connected, and then you left three days later. Thus, I was almost left alone with A., K. from time to time, and the boys in my room to a more superficial level. I am indeed a pretty extrovert and social person, but when it comes to connection, it is commonly difficult to find people that understand me on a deeper level and that can offer me some useful help when I need it. This is partly what your intuition told you when you asked me if I had friends to speak with here in Brussels. Well, now you see. When it comes to friends, let’s say it is somewhat difficult but still easy, because mentioning romantic partners, things become twice as difficult, since 50% of the population are left out. But even worse, considering that my age keeps on growing, I am already 26, and that people tend to establish their lives in monogamous relationships, and that I am kind of picky with the physical appearance as well, chances of finding a fulfilling romantic partner keeps on reducing. However, I can think that a girl with a mindset that attracts me will probably be in similar circumstances, and she will also take care of her physical appearance. Thus, this increases the odds a bit. But who knows, it keeps on being difficult to find the people to connect with. So, we’ll see how A.’s relationships grow, but I stop having expectations about pretty much everything, surrender to life, keep on enjoying the process, and remain optimistic about what the future is bringing. She will come. They will come. We will meet. But yeah, some days get heavier than others. About how to invest my time. I used to remember when I was a teenager with less of those passive spiritual skills that I am growing these days (tolerance, patience, silence, surrender, empathy, compassion…), how difficult and annoying it was for me to participate in a conversation of a topic that I didn’t care about. I see myself standing silently listening to some personal bullshit about Joe Johnson having a conflict with John Jowson, and Jey Jamison wanting to spend more time with Jane Jannetson. Really, it was all so purposeless. I grew up with the belief that listening to mediocre people’s lives was a waste of time compared with reading a high-quality book. However, my low threshold for loneliness and my appreciation for excellence trapped me at both endings of the rope, arriving at the point where I am not good at any of them. Thus, in my gloomiest moments, I came up thinking that I am neither a solitary successful artist, nor a famous loved leader, I am somewhat in between, and none of both at the same time. An almost-but-not-really. Later on, the future and my humility taught me that I could learn something from everyone. I just had to find their field of expertise, I just had to ask the right questions and discover what the passion of that person was, what were their inner motivators and what could I learn from their life experiences. But it took effort, time, and in many occasions, frustrations from both parts, since it seemed that the conversation was leading nowhere. Either they didn’t have any passion (which I wouldn’t like to think as true); or they didn’t want to share it me (maybe avoiding to acknowledge that they were being neglected to their true dreams); or I wasn’t making the right questions to discover their passions (which I kept on trying and trying). In one of the first Spanish social networks, Tuenti, I used to ask my digital friends: “Que paso?” instead of “¿Qué pasó?”. We didn’t care much about orthographic mistakes, so the sentences had the same meaning. However, to me, it was a silent cry out of my disdain towards that life and form of communication. “¿Qué pasó?” can be translated as “What happened?” while “Que paso” can be translated as “I am not interested in that” or “I am over it”. I was about 15 when my mind was already walking those paths. Thus, I learned to invest my time as best as I could, talking with different people outside of my environment, people willing to challenge my beliefs, that showed me other aspects of reality that I hadn’t been able to discover by myself. At some point, that led me to change my Scout group, later to go to another city for my university studies, then to another city, then to another country, then to another country… And also, I grew really fan of exploring different cultures, different peoples, of realizing how little and small was my view of the world, and how much was there outside to be discovered. However, each time I met my friends from my hometown… You know, it was that feeling of being more disconnected to them. They had been my friends from my childhood, but my mind, views, and experiences had shown me that there was much more out there to be seen. On the other hand, those wonderful people that I had met on my trip kept going on with their lives, and I was again trapped in between, stuck in the middle. Those paradoxes that enslaved me in no sapiens’ land. Therefore, this is my life. Brussels, a Ph.D. that doesn’t fully fulfill me, many dreams to accomplish, and a gestating loneliness that is always ready to ambush me when I guard down. I think 10 pages are enough. Only to add that I am a bit cheerful because I met an Argentinian violoncello player that may bring some light to my near future, and that we are still living in a hypocritical society. I arrived in Vienna. I started to see all the Mozart marketing and I thought: “Mozart?! What did Mozart do? Only music… Bah. For a guy that only did music this is really too much promotion.” You know, 2019… Just in case someone even felt the same fear as I do when I think about stopping the Ph.D. and focus on the dance, as some of my friends without basic education are currently doing. Reminders of what being an artist means in the short and the long term. But it doesn’t matter. J., the Argentinian, is a cello player, braver than me. And Mozart, well, he was just a musician. I am also somehow in between, training and dancing at home from time to time while keeping it up with the Ph.D.. I am going to correct a couple of master’s thesis that I am supposedly interested in: “How Buddhism impacts happiness” and “Preferences of colors and links with the personality and values”. Thanks for reading In.. Don’t feel obliged to answer. I just wish that you are doing well, you are enjoying your life, and you are helping to have a better life to those that live around you. Tons of love, Carlos PS. I recently saw the piece of John Oliver on Boris Johnson and… Congratulations to your Prime Minister. Good luck with the negotiations. PS. I may start with your book soon8. I recently finished the one of the frugivore diet9 and I am a bit delayed with some psychological titles that I would like to get read. But yours will surely expand my socio-geo-political views and make me a more interesting and sexy guy in the socio-political circles of trainees in Place de Luxembourg. You know, investing time to pretend to be interested in people one doesn’t care about. At least, I am not spending my money on consumerism. Conspicuous consumption, a term that I recently learned. Have fun. Till date, In. hasn’t answered. Maybe it was too much burden for a single person. 12 days of silence (2019-08-25). I sent you a picture of a picture of a Werewolf stand in a boardgames fair in Brussels. It was a bait. I tried to start talking again with you, and check that you were alive. But you didn’t bite it. I was deeply confused. I had sent you my whole mind and consciousness with those forty pages and I was receiving a totally inscrutable silence. I was deeply unsure about how you had taken it. I was worrying whether it had been a good idea to send it or not. It had happened on the past, that I had opened myself up to some people and they had been scared by it. But with yourself, it had been different. That is why I felt confident about it. But then, silence? I was lost about what that silence meant. Were you busy? Were you writing back? Had I said something I wasn’t suppose to say? I didn’t want to come across as needy or pushy. I knew that you needed you own space, that you were special, that you could turn non-communicative and that you were in a busy period. The days of your silence had been quite good for me. I had been in Vienna, Slovenia, and Croatia visiting friends and occupying my days with sightseeing, new people, nature, hiking, mountain, and beach. I had talked with excitement about you with my friends. They had recognized that the whole thing was weird. But they saw me happy and lively, so why shouldn’t I invest in the relationship? However, little by little, Brussels was imposing its reality, and life wasn’t that interesting anymore. Loneliness was coming back. Days were feeling long and empty, and despite the good weather, many times there was no one to out with. During those days, I hung out with some teenagers that I had randomly met one night. One of my friends was busy preparing exams, another was travelling, and a young guy I started meeting was nice, but not intellectually stimulating. After your appearance in my life, there wasn’t anyone as interesting as you. However, one night, after training some strength and balancing exercises in a park, while they were smoking weed, we went together to one of their houses. The family of the teenager were bourgeoisie. And the peak moment of their performance was when they ordered McDonald’s food that was brought by a Deliveroo biker, paid with their parents money, to subsequently being eaten silently with the light of their smartphones on their faces. It was a very strong experience for me. Being in a room with 5 friends, supposedly in an age for rebellion and wild-spirit, being swallowed by capitalism, buying the quimera of having your own ready-to-eat food at the comfort of your place without doing anything. I felt compassionate of the biker while I observed how they were feeding this machine that was poisoning them with the trashest of the food, the most inconsequential online feed, the less compassionate form of labouring, the quickest way to grow disconnected from human social nature. Eventually, after 5 minutes of well-deserved hedonism, they filled the trash with the packaging. I had asked the owner of the house for an orange. I had my bottle of water. I was stretching and exercising my fingers with some dusty gym weights that I found in a corner of the room. They tried to mock my weirdness, and I astonishingly found myself defending and explaining the logic of my behavior, while avoiding, from the wholeness of my being, pointing out the craziness of theirs. That evening I realized I had to keep searching for my social circles. At least one of them shared a post of one of my exercises and sentences that night. Besides, concerning work, I also experienced recurrent existential crisis. One morning, I wrote a letter to my friend Al. Letter to Al. (2019-08-27) 13.16 Louvain la Neuve (Belgium), my office. Extremely unfocused. Hello Al., I write in English to save a translation in the future. All will be published. It has been some strange days and I keep on questioning what I really want to do with my life and my time. I ask people around how difficult life is, but they don’t seem to understand what I mean by that question. Putting it simply, I have two options. Option one is to continue with the Ph.D. here in Belgium where I feel I am not growing enough, I am not contributing enough, and I am getting to comfortable and stable. Pros: I am saving about 1.500€ per month, which has let me accumulate about 20k along these two years in Brussels. It is a comfortable life, not many responsibilities, not many stresses, not rushed schedules. I have time to read, which is something I am probably overdoing. I have time to write, which is something I am underdoing. Option two is stopping with the Ph.D. and investing my 100% in my independent online projects, my writing projects, and joining MindValley, a company with shared values and aspirations. Cons: Fear, unpredictability, instability… Asking around gives me ambiguous answers. F., the Ph.D. student that finished this year and is leaving this month, almost fully regretted the experience. It may be his negative personality, or the fact that he didn’t properly manage his time, social relationships, and growth along these five years in Belgium. He said that doing a Ph.D. in Belgium has one of the best conditions in the world. He still stands by it. Conditions are great: good salary, not much work, and not that much pressure. However, for him, the whole experience has been a painful one, with his mind worrying him constantly, and being upset about the consequences of his academic decisions. Being fair, I think that he is way more careful, meticulous, and dedicated than me. Luckily, my mind is more under control, or that is what I like to think. So it doesn’t bother me much, at least with things related with the Ph.D.. Second person I asked was Fe.. Fe. is the cleaning lady of R., the landlord of the building where I live, the owner of Mortimer, the dog I dog-sit. Fe. told me that I should stay in Brussels, saving money, making up my small fortune. Money is good, money is okay. But when I look at the future, when I look at the past, I have the feeling that I have mortgaged my life to money. It seems that I have taken so many decisions just based on money that it is a bit annoying continuing doing the same after so many years. Why didn’t I go to the Jamboree 2011? Money. Why did I live alone in Salamanca for two years? Money. Why did I live in the terrace of a house with 20 other students in Leuven? Money. Why did I go to Denmark without knowing anyone, without having any clear plan? Money. Why did I destroy romantic relationship, and friendships in the past? Money. Why did I travel the way I travelled? Money. I am not complaining or regretting all those decisions. Many of them were mistakes, many of them made my life more miserable that I would probably need. But all of them made me who I am today. That is what it is, and there is nothing I can change now. But remaining here for three years more just for the money seems a bit of a stretch of what I actually want to do with my life. Fi. says that I will get a qualification when I finish the Ph.D., but do I want a qualification? Do I want to spend three years of my life here for a qualification? I am not sure at all. I want to create an impact in the world, I want to change things, I want to see how people change their views about life, about spirituality, about ecology, about their behavior and its consequences. And what I am doing are petty experiments about whether nature affects moral behavior in urban dwellers. Well, nature is disappearing, so, who knows? Being on nature makes people more prosocial, more helpful, more generous, more altruistic. But then, it is our project, where we try to tackle if nature’s moral impact reaches further. Does nature make people more conservative, more progressist? Who knows? We don’t. Anyway, one of the advantages of being here is that I can see how science is built, how it is constructed. If I had my doubts about psychological science before, now they are not doing anything other than increasing. There are not clear results, there are just stretched conclusions out of statistical findings of dubious quality. I am fully ignorant about other science supposedly more rigorous, like medicine, or biology. But considering social sciences, I would remain doubtful in the best of the cases. I think that, by 2030 global data and artificial intelligences will discover more about human beings in 3 months, than what we have discovered in all previous research combined. And of better quality. Anyway, we do our best, and that should suffice. But it doesn’t not satisfy me. Supposedly, we can divide people into satisfiers and maximizers [@parker2007maximizers]. I am a satisfier in all those petty decisions that I think will not have a huge relevance in my life. But concerning what I want to do with my time, how I want to spend it, and with whom, I am quite a maximizer. I have been alone, and I don’t have numerous people that fully inspire and motivate me. But I prefer that than having tons of shallow relationships that I feel are leading me nowhere. I wrote it in a letter to a friend a couple of days ago. I was analyzing why I am sometimes angry or hateful towards people and the idea of sexual frustration appeared, but I discarded for the probably more accurate explanation of connection frustration. That is the thing, I am having difficulties with finding people that really fulfill me and that interest me as a person beyond spending some evening together just letting the time pass by. We will see what the future brings, and maybe, if it brings some interesting connections and people that make me grow, I will consider a bit further my situation. However, I can only blame myself for the promotion or lack of growth. I know that I am a bit stuck these days because I have altered many elements of the well-being routine that I was developing. That is what happens when I travel. I have enjoyed and grown a lot during my weeks in France and Vienna-Slovenia-Croatia, but when I see myself in Brussels, I have to work hard again to recover the habits that took me some time to build. Also, in a couple of days I am flying to Poland for a conference, which implies another week of rupture of my habits. These days also, I am trying a diet that I think I am going to quit. I have been happily eating from the trash during the last year and a half, saving money and reducing my already precarious consumerist behavior. However, I wanted to give a chance to a raw vegan diet consisting primarily of fruits, but it has been more difficult than I thought. The advantage of this small experiment is that I am more conscious of what I eat, I can fast for longer, keep on functioning with low levels of energy, and probably, I have cleaned my body from many accumulated toxins. But this morning, I was about puking. The last thing I ate were some grapes last night, and today at 11 am, about 12 hours later, I was feeling like vomiting. Later on, when I went to the toilet, I had some problems as well, but I couldn’t remember what I had eaten to have those difficulties. Anyway, I bought a baguette, I ate it, and it seemed that the bread did well in stabilizing my stomach. One of the reasons I wanted to try this diet is that a friend of a friend, who, by now, I can call my friend, recommended it to me, mentioning that my intuition would get way better. You know that I am a bit skeptical of all those things. But I am receiving similar information from different sources and I am always open to giving it a chance and playing around with my brain and life. Actually, after my Vipassana experience, I cannot be sure anymore of what my body and mind are able to do; and observing how science is being constructed, I am open to trying more esoteric things just to see if they have any type of impact in myself and the way I function. Thus, I know not growing is my fault, and I actually should save some time to develop my intuition. There are several exercises to practice. During the weekend, I found some time to practice some of these, and I got scared at the fact that many things seemed to match, to have sense. There is this concept of “synchronicities”, of weird coincidences that seem to have been designed for us explicitly, to give us a specific type of lesson, or a message. And when I pay attention, many of these seem to happen repeatedly. I am meditating, I get to a conclusion, and the alarm goes off. I am talking with someone and before sending a message that I shouldn’t send, my phone crashes down… I am not sure whether I am going crazy or there is a reason all this is happening to me. The thing is that I am deeply afraid of following my intuition, because following my intuition would surely mean to stop with the Ph.D. and venture forward to do something that I find more meaningful and valuable. That is the thing. “What if’s” here and there. Those are my fears. If I should go against the rational and common sense, secure view of life and stick to the Ph.D. for three years more while I am saving money and earning a qualification; or dedicate my full time to focus on what I really believe that can change the world and have an impact on society. I haven’t checked my intuition, or I haven’t tried all the opportunities I could try, and it is because deep inside, I have the hunch that they may offer me a future that I like more than what I currently have, and that would make things more difficult. The safest way is to keep on developing my online presence and profile while I am doing the Ph.D., but these divided purposes don’t match anymore. Also, another problem is that when I have a free day, I find myself procrastinating and not doing what I should be doing, what I have to do, my commitments, which makes me question about myself and my validity as an independent worker. I am a bit trapped in this. Also, I am in a moment where I would love to work with other people, with people that can push me forward, that can bring value to what I do and what I have. But it seems complicated to find them. I also remind myself many times that I have to be patient, that I have to work daily with the focus on the long term, and don’t stress out myself with what I already have and where I am going. It gets a bit complicated to handle the pressure that I put on myself for these types of matters. It gets confusing as well. I don’t know, Alvaro. I am sharing this with you because we recently talked by instant messaging and you know how little I like superficial things, and how keen I am of more meaningful stuff. I am not sure whether your advice, if any, is going to be the one I look for, or one that really works for me. Difficult to say anyways. But it would be interesting to know about the changes that are going on in your life right now. Let me know. And yes, let’s meet at some point. Not so late. Best, Carlos The day before Poland, I tried to be social again. I met a young guy that has just started his path on personal development. It was charming to observe somehow, due to his humble and quite uneducated origins, combined with a strong commitment to work hard and push himself beyond his dreams. It was a bit cliché hearing all those coaching slogans and lessons that, from my opinion, I had not only overcome, but improved and nuanced. Anyways, he was brave, since he was barely speaking english, and was already working and living in a foreign country. I wanted to amuse myself, so we went to the park, and I spent some time practicing my new hobby: funambulism. I liked those Russian guys that filmed themselves climbing buildings, and walking on cornices. It was the excitement I needed in my life.The only stimulating challenge that I could find around me. And to a more archetypical level, it was a perfect metaphor of the situation I was entering in my life. A lot of potential growth with a lot of potential damage. At least, I had the conference in Poland (2019-08-29 to 2019-09-03) about Psychology of Religion . Ironically, I consider that, professionally speaking, my biggets improvement was done by establishing an email communication with Ad., the father of my friend B. who is a well-known Croatian publisher and writer within the world of spirituality that was kind enough to give me some feedback and guidance concerning my ideas on spirituality. Correspondence with Ad. (2019-08-22 to 2019-09-03) 2019-08-22 Hello Adrian, I am Carlos, B.’s Spanish friend. I am aware that he has talked to you about me. :) He mentioned that it would be possible for me to share some of my text and ideas with you, and in case you liked them, we could agree with publication planning. I wrote an index with the idea of a book linking spirituality and science from a psychological perspective. I would like to share the index with you, receive feedback from you, and then move forward with the writing. It would be great to know what is your preferred way to share this with you. Thank you very much for having such a wonderful kid, and thank you for all the value you are bringing to the world. Best, 2019-08-22 Hi Carlos, Yes, B. told me about you. I am glad that you two are friends. :) Not sure, though, what you expect from me. I am not a publisher, and as for writing, well… One would think that 40+ published books is a success, and for sure it is a kind of success. But, I am not feeling qualified for guiding a young aspiring author, such as you. But we can talk if you like. Instead of an Index, tell me what you want to say through your writings. If you can say it in a few sentences, your ideas are probably clear and worth pursuing. Adrian 2019-08-31 Hello Adrian, Thank you very much for your answer and for your interest in my person and development. B. mentioned that you were thinking about opening a publishing house. Also, he mentioned your numerous creations and that is why I still think that you could be a great influence and help for my development as a writer. I am currently in a conference about Psychology of Religion in Poland, so it has been a busy time with the preparations. What I aim with my writings is to re-discover spirituality from a (scientific) psychological perspective. My three attitudes in this exploration are humility (I don’t know), curiosity (I want to know), and doubt (can I believe what I am told?). My goal is to learn how to elicit spiritual and transformative experiences in people as strong as the ones I have experienced in the past (that changed my being and the way I understand the world). Spirituality can be the perfect tool for achieving a change in the awareness that would redirect humanity towards a more sustainable and thriving future. That is pretty much my goal for writing and publishing. Some of my beliefs and approaches are that spirituality is an alternative functioning of the brain and the mind, that has a specific set of characteristics. The development of a spiritual life makes people behave more prosocially. Concerning religions, for me, religions are metaphors. Religions are different manifestations and interpretations of that core spirituality that we all have inside. From my training as a positive psychologist, I can easily relate many spiritual feelings and emotions with positive emotions studied by scientific literature. However, there are a huge amount of mysteries that are still to be studied and untangled. I hope I haven’t gotten too long with my explanations. But those are the main motivations and ideas that are around my mind at this moment. I would like to bridge scientific studies with more esoteric aspects of spirituality and re-interpret religious text under the perspective of science; using ancient scriptures to develop new theories and hypotheses. Thanks for your time, Carlos 31.08.2019 Hi Carlos, :-) As I wrote, we can talk. The outcome… who can say? :-) Let me answer your third question (“Can I believe what I am told?”). You can’t, and you shouldn’t. Ever. :-) As for the rest - it sounds nice, but… Is there any definition of “spirituality” you accepted, so you now operate under its premises? Because, you know, “spirituality” is a vast field, somewhat chaotic, constructed from a milliard of different approaches (sometimes opposite to one another), and practiced by so many people with so many goals and, consequently, resulting in so many outcomes. I hope you are not from those who would say that “all is one” and “all paths lead to Rome” (because they don’t). :-) I am in “spirituality” from my 13th birthday. It is more than four decades of lifelong dedication, no compromises, no sidewalks. I have seen and experienced so much that the word itself - spirituality - doesn’t mean much anymore. I deal with people who want to cure insomnia with the mediation; spiritual tourists going on every new workshop in town; new-age types who desperately want that life would be only about hugs, kisses, and flowers; losers running away from responsibilities; goal-driven manifestators; religious renegades disappointed in the institutions but firmly sticking to their beliefs; honest but lost searchers who just want the peace of mind; health fanatics… and many more. Here and there, rarely, I came across someone ready to look into the true reality of our lives, no matter the cost. All those people practice different techniques with different results. Some of them are better off after that, but I have seen the psychosis and other serious disorders directly resulting from practicing “spirituality.” Yes, sometimes, “spirituality” was the cure for that, of course. So, to cut things short - what are you talking about? :-) What spirituality? Cheers, Adrian PS: You wrote that you are a “positive psychologist”. I am ignorant in such distinctions, so I will just ask - are there “negative psychologists,” too? Or, “neutral psychologists”? :-) 2019-09-03 Gdansk, Hello Adrian, Thanks for keeping on challenging my boundaries. Today is the last day of the International Association of Psychology of Religion 2019 conference here in Gdansk. It has been a wonderful place to get inspiration, expose myself to many different approaches to spirituality and religion, and to stimulate my mind towards developing more operationalizable definitions of spirituality. I wouldn’t like to be reductionist, but this morning, talking with a potential collaborator from an American university, Christopher Silver, I remembered some ideas that I had a few years ago and that are, what I considered, the foundations of “spirituality” or “mysticism” as I conceived it. Referring again to my formation as a psychologist, I would like to define spirituality based on its psychological characteristics and effects on psychological processes. I am aware of some of those interpretations and manifestations of “spirituality” that you mentioned. Indeed, coming to this type of conferences is really helpful to keep on broadening my mind about the endless interpretations and outcomes of “spirituality”. Religious and spiritual, spiritual and non-religious, many possible religions, many types of practices, many ways to say what “spirituality” is, and what is not. That is why, today I realized that researching about the most basic psychological processes and its connection with “spirituality” should be a solid starting point. I believe spirituality happens on the mind, on the brain. I don’t know if it happens outside (energies, and souls), but for sure, at some level the mind and the brain are involved. That is why, attention, as the most basic and undeniable access of information to our consciousness, is surely playing a key role. Then, at the perceptual level, sensitivity, the threshold that allows people to perceive, “sense”, reality is filtering what enters the consciousness. Attention is the door that communicates the reality (inner and outer world, e.g. thoughts and feelings) with our perception, which allows information to enter in our consciousness. In the same way attention can be trained, (Anapana meditation), sensitivity can be trained as well, (Vipassana meditation, and subtle levels of our mind/reality). Thus, we could develop an increased or heightened awareness of the world, an expansion of our consciousness. Thus, spirituality is an alternative functioning of the mind (not experienced by westerners’ minds on a daily basis) that is characterized by a more focused and controllable attention (stronger samadhi, as I understood it in my Vipassana meditation course of 10 days by Goenka), an increased levels of sensitivity, higher usage and trust on intuitive thinking, and reduced logical-mathematical thinking (non-duality phenomena), difficult to verbalize (ineffability), that is felt as truth and valid source of knowledge (noetic), general positive affect and mood, and overall optimism (hope, tolerance, forgiveness); together with several cognitive biases: finding meaning in aleatory patterns, anthropo-teleological reasoning (explanations of the universe on base of its functionality for human beings, e.g. “The earth has been created for humankind to live in”), and others that I would need to examine and think about more carefully. I would take a phenomenological approach and define spirituality based on what seems to be common among different cultures and religions, instead of focusing on the different interpretations of these processes. Although, from a cultural perspective, spirituality is the term used by many people to frame this different psychological phenomenology, while trying to avoid the mythological and cultural elements. Thus, with a more cultural approach, spirituality is a non-theistic individualized, and tailored religion. It is a self-developed set of beliefs and practices that aim to connect the individual with the transcendence. In many cases, this spirituality is sparked by a mystic experience, and refined and developed through time, by trial and error of different practices and a process of updating personal beliefs. I am not denying any epistemological possibility with my definition. I am simply recognizing the existence of the experience, and claims of “spiritual people”, while not denying or supporting the validity, or “truthfulness” of the interpretations of these experiences and claims. Whether energy or karma are truth or not, it is unimportant at this point, what it interests me is that people experience these situations, and how science could explain what is going on, exploring all the psychological alterations further than cognitive biases that lead to questionable judgments about reality. For example, I like to explain the concept of karma (softer westernized version of: “You do something good, and good things happen to you”), as a form of prosociality spread through the social network. Or the concept of reincarnation as how our “self” and worldviews are constantly changing (e.g. when I wake up in the morning, I am not the same person that I was when I went to sleep. It seems like I have been reborn, that I have been reincarnated in a new person). As I mentioned in my previous email, I would like to bridge between atheist denying the potential benefits of exploring their spirituality, beyond claiming about the truthfulness of its content; and those people that consume commercialized spirituality with a potential risk for their health (e.g. anti-vaccines, or people that avoid western medicine to prioritize alternative therapies). I try to keep my humble attitude and I wouldn’t like to impose my reductionist scientism to dictate what is good and what is bad. I think we all should strive to find the truth and communicate and spread these different worldviews. About the “all paths lead to Rome”, William James in The varieties of religious experiences [@james1985varieties] wrote about the common phenomenology of a mystic experience (“one path leads to different Romes?”). The mystic experience seems to be happening on healthy human beings. It is afterwards, when the interpretation and the set of beliefs of the individual when this “one path leads to different destinations”. In my case, I was lucky to discover Taoism simultaneously with my first experience, so I could apply my (non-)interpretations of the frameless frame (ineffable truths) of the Dao De Jing to my mystic experience. This allowed me to interpret many other religions and start making sense of what “God” and “Jesus love” could mean for many Christians. Positive psychology is a movement in the scientific community to promote psychological research in the “positive” aspects of life (pleasurable emotions, social relationships, engagement at work, virtues and character strengths, optimism…). I got interested about it during a lecture on my last year of university. After my first spiritual experience, I felt numerous “positive” changes in myself (I was happier, more motivated, prosocial, patient, optimistic…). Thus, I thought that positive psychology was the best way to approach the study of spirituality. Then, I read some of the works of the main authors on the field and enrolled in the Master program. Nowadays, I am doing my Ph.D. with Vassilis Saroglou which has extensively researched different links between religion, spirituality, transcendental positive emotions, prosociality, personality and culture. He is well-known in the field, and I feel lucky to work with him. However, the topic of my Ph.D. is quite limited, and I would like to read, write and explore many other topics that are not as scientifically accepted as the relations between nature and morality. That is why; I would love to publish papers about potential psychological interpretations of Hinduism with B., and I would love to receive some orientation about how and what to publish about the ideas aforementioned; how to make them attractive and accessible to a broader number of people, and how to present them in an organized way, easy to understand, and applicable to one’s life. I hope I have further clarified my point of view and that I haven’t extended myself too much with the length of the email. Thanks again for your time. Carlos Hi Carlos, About challenging your boundaries, well, you asked for it. I’m still not sure if that will do anything good for your writings, but let’s see… :-) Long it is… :-) Referring again to my formation as a psychologist, I would like to define spirituality based on its psychological characteristics and effects on psychological processes. Linking spirituality to psychological processes would be very interesting, for sure. But, again, how would you do it if you deal with so many different things? You have to make a gross and fine differentiations inside the very - VERY - vast field. Otherwise, your results may show that “spirituality enhances XY, improves ZW, etc.” while “spirituality” itself will be questioned. I can live with that, but I am not sure science can. :-) I am trying to explain to you what happens in my mind when you write “spirituality.” A similar thing would happen if you wrote to me that “you like to explore the influence of the material world on human psychology”. It is just… too general, too vast. That is why I am suggesting to clarify to yourself what you are actually researching. And you did it in the next paragraph in your mail. I have nothing against it. All that is indeed spirituality - with all its contradictions and vagueness. I made some comments as pointers in the direction beyond spirituality. They are just quick thoughts. It is not clear to me where the distinction is between inside and outside the mind. The very existence of “outside” is a non-provable assumption (made equally by scientists, common people, religious and spiritual). Attention makes you aware of something that is already there, regardless of your knowledge about it. There is no such thing as “expansion of consciousness”. :-) It is just a phrase. What is possible is the expansion of awareness - you can become aware of what is here using specific techniques. A lot to say about attention. It would be too long. Short version, focused attention is not samadhi. And focused and controllable attention can be developed without any need for spirituality (whatever it is). It is just a human ability. About sensitivity, do you mean perceptual sensitivity? Better sight, hearing? Again, not exclusive to spirituality. What is “higher usage”? Who is to say that using an ability is low or high? Oh, non-duality is much more than reduced or non-logical thinking! Trust in the intuitive… Well, do you trust your hands that they will be able to type an email? If “trust” is the correct word in that case, then ok, you can say that you need trusting the intuition… About ineffability, noetic, positive mood and optimism, nice. But that has nothing to do with truth and reality. It has everything to do with human needs and interpretations. So, you see - a very vast field, that spirituality! The problem is: if all that goes under the name - spirituality, do you really think that there is a set of patterns, a distinctive model of the brain (or mind) that would show - this is spiritual, and that is not? About the phenomenological approach, well, if you remain descriptive, you are on much safer grounds than if you try to explain what is happening. Thus, with a more cultural approach, spirituality is a non-theistic individualized and tailored religion. It is a self-developed set of beliefs and practices that aim to connect the individual with the transcendence. Maybe. The problem is that “set of beliefs” cannot connect you with the transcendence (of course, you will have to explain what you mean by that - the word transcendence, and the idea of connection, both). Practices can do that, but not all of them. As far as I am concerned, at the moment belief enters the stage, the truth has already left it. About your focus on the experiences, it sounds good. If you can clearly say what experiences you are considering spiritual, and clearly distinguish them from the ones you consider non-spiritual. That is a hard task, you know. No objections to your interpretation of eastern concepts. :-) I understand your intention of bridgening different audiences. It is just that the “truth” and \"worldviews’’ are not on the same level of existence. Yes, experiences happen to humans. And what you mention is possible. But, there is a plural: mystic experiences, not one mystic experience. And there are interpretations of those experiences. So, I suppose there is no “negative psychology”. No one is interested in that. ;-) About your Ph.D., it sounds great. My recommendation is to suppress your other interest and focus on your Ph.D. topics as adviced and approved by your mentor. Once you gain academic authority, you will be much more free in your choices of topics and writings. Publishing with B. is an excellent idea, and you both have my full support if you decide to do it. Well, as the one being on the market of books for almost four decades, I can tell you that it is not an easy task. You will have to make compromises with human desires, needs, beliefs, and even fashion. And I still have no recipe for achieving that efficiently. Probably, the best thing is to start with simple ideas, not too general, and as practical as it gets (the scientist and academic in you will have to go sleep for a while, or at least withdraw himself from the spotlight). No problem, Carlos. I am glad to talk to you. At the moment I have some extra time, but very soon the season of lectures and workshops will begin. I am also preparing a couple of new interesting projects, so I will write as time allows. Wishing you all the best and thank you for your interest. It is of great value that young people like you focus their attention on… well, that damn spirituality. :-) During the days of the conference, I kept my mind busy and my social needs somewhat satisfied. However, I had a strong outburst of loneliness during the last day of the conference. the whole academia world seemed very unreal to me compared with the rawness we have lived in France. I missed that authenticity that I couldn’t find among scholars. I felt disconnected from my colleagues. I felt disconnected with the rest of researchers and academics. After my presentation, the nervousness of preparing my talk gone. The emotional opponent process wasn’t relief, though. It was emptiness. And I fill that emptiness with feelings of disconnection from everyone. I wasn’t sure why I was there. You were in my mind, and it had been already 21 days of silence. I was completely puzzled. I had been thinking about you, struggling to control myself and not texting you. But that day, I couldn’t. I texted you. I tried again. — A. Can you send me the pics of the exchange, please? And I would like to know if everything is fine What in your mind and all that The messages appeared as read, but they remained unanswered. Some of my friends were already recommending me to be over you. You had ghosted me. You had flaked on me. I just had to accept that you were over. Probably you had read something from my letter that you hadn’t like. Well, it happened again. I never learnt how to keep playing the rules of the game. “Don’t disclose all the information at once. Don’t give away all your power.” I thought that with you it could be different, that I could be myself, that I could be open and honest. And there they were the results. Full silence. 2.1.3 Requesting divine interventions (2019-09-04 to 2019-09-07) One day later (2019-09-04), I decided to text K.. It wasn’t the smartest, but I didn’t have a clue about you. My mind was going to multiple places, to numerous possibilities. I didn’t want to buy the version where you have just completely forgotten about me. I wanted to considered alternative scenarios. In the worst of the cases, you might be simply dead, or in the hospital, and I was waiting for your answer that would never arrived. I wanted to cleap up, at least, the worst of the doubts. — How are you? — Perfect!!! How are you?? — I’m in Eindhoven now After a week in Gdansk In a conference of psychology of religion — And how’s going? — Pretty well I’m a bit stranged that Alissija stopped answering my messages She remained silent. I guess I fucked up by bringing up the topic too soon. But she wasn’t very talkative, and I had already asked about how she was… Next day (2019-09-05), I sent her a photo that was left unanswered as well. Well, I have just played myself. Two non-answering people more in my life. But I didn’t give up so easily and next day, I tried again: — Karolina stopped answered as well? — I didn’t like the fact, that you wrote me just to ask about Alissija. Ouch! Fully caught… However, she was talking. She was answering. I had to be smoother this time. — I am always welcome to know about how your life is going I told you as well my willingness to write letters so we can share each other’s experiences If you got offended because of that, I hope you can forgive me She texted me a sort of letter: — My dear Carlito Burlito, It’s a big pleasure for me to be connected with person like you. Time we spent together was one of the most interesting moments in my life. Thank you for making me laugh :-) Right now, I’m trying to figure out what would I like to study in future. For one moment I even wanted to study medicine. What about your life? Why you decided to study psychology? With best wishes and kisses Your K. Well, that was the best I could get for the moment. — How long do you want the answer? — The same as I wrote you :-) That was a challenge, since my letters averaged four pages in a word file at that period of my life. But I tried: — My dear Karolina, I also learned lots from you and our conversation. Thanks for keeping me humble and reminding me that my worldviews are very limited. What are the options you are thinking about? Medicine is a great career. If you finally choose it, apart from helping human beings and saving lives, you’ll discover the intricacies of the human body functioning, which I also find compelling. About my life, as I mentioned, all is good, but the realization that the person that I thought I could open up and trust on now stopped communicating with me without any explanation is quite disturbing and hurtful. What would you do if something like this happens to you? I chose psychology because I wanted to understand human beings, I wanted to know why we are as we are, and 9 years later, although I have partially solved many of my doubts, human beings keep on surprising me and catch me unprepared in many occasions. Always learning. Love and peace, CF — Bit longer, sorry Of course, it hurt. How was it not supposed to hurt when the person you trust, the person that supposedly love you and the one that you love stopped communicating for almost a month without any explanation after you shared your whole being with her? Really, that wasn’t supposed to hurt? But, the situation changed. My message worked wonders. Just 5 hours later, and A. broke 25 days of silence. K’s divine intervention had worked. — Thanks K. 2.2 Magnetism (2019-09-08 to 2019-) 2.2.1 Intermittences (2019-09-08 to 2019-09-22) You, A., broke your silence with a sort of letter, much in the way K. had done it. — Hi dear, Unfortunately the pictures are not in my reach at the moment. Everything is as life is, you know 😀 So it’s interesting… The school started, the homework started. I’m glad it’s giving me these small goals to achieve. So I’m almost not overthinking. Just in the evenings. But also my overthinking is useful here. And all the other ‘’defects’’ as they are usually seen are welcome here (at least I put them this way) so I feel like I’m in the right place. I still do not have Wi-Fi (for two more days, I’ll get it on Tuesday) So don’t be too sad that I’m not answering. And how are you, dear Carlos? — Thanks for the message. I’m still dependent on human beings. Text you later And thanks Karolina for her divine intervention So, that was it. You haven’t had internet in all this time. Your message was warm and sort of hopeful and positive. I was happy about how you were feeling like you were in the right place. I was somehow envy of you, since I was craving more artistic environments, and you were starting your studies of theater. I was relieved by your words, but I still remembered how much you had made me wait. Thus, I took two days to answer you back (2019-09-10). A picture of a kid grabbing a huge bug was very much a reminder of you. However, that day I didn’t pay attention to that octopus tentacle… Many things were going on in my life during the beginning of September10 — I would write you a letter about my mind/development, but I don’t want you to feel force to write or overwhelm with my stuff I can also briefly tell you that all is fine And about you in the school, enjoy and grow As you said “defects” are inspiration and if your mind starts bullying you and you want to talk / write to someone I listen These ones if you get bored I sent you some pictures of animals that I thought you would like, since the pics were very well done and the animals were quite weird. Considering how much you enjoyed doing pics to dead bees, and observing bugs, it could surely be a good thing for you. Ironically, K. answered me to my last question about “What would you do if the person you trusted stop talking to you?” — Good evening. Thank you for writing me back and for waiting my answer. About the person who stopped talk to you. Maybe this person is really busy, or “she” doesn’t ready to talk right now. Actually, I’m at the same position as you right now. One man who I felt in love with just stopped talk to me. But I probably understand why. So, we both, me and you, should learn something from this situation. Right now, I feel a little bit pain, but I realized that I can use it to create music. And when I look at the young girls, I don’t want them to feel this pain I did. But somehow it changed me, so I don’t know now, if it’s good or not. Hug you very tight ❤️ And wish you a good night! Two days later (2019-09-12), which I understood as an okay time for answering, you wrote back: — Oh here I am afraid I have no time at all to be bored. You can write me a letter if you wish to share, I will not feel forced to reply right away, besides I believe you understand the business of shit I’m dealing with in this school now 😀 Oh btw do you know to recommend me some theater schools in Spain (knowing my interests briefly) where I could go for a semester? — Remind me your interests I know more about dance than theater, but I have some friends that have done acting/directing The day after (2019-09-13), I felt deepy misserable. I had been overusing my phone, it was Friday Meanwhile, I was talking with K. Our relationship seemed to be warmer. who had posted on Facebook a quite insinuating thought. I felt motivated enough to write her a proper letter Letter to K. (2019-09-16) Louvain La Neuve, Belgium Hello K., I am not used to quick, short letters written under pressure. I prefer long ones with the possibility of spending weeks without answering. To strengthen my patience, the receiver’s patience, and adapt to the unexpected evolution of life. Instant communication is just to give messages about how everything is going well, asking for emotional or practical support in moments of need, or arranging and organizing meetings. That is my view. Although, I understand that it is not really accepted. Other’s people problem. Actually, I don’t have a smartphone anymore. I am using an old phone with keys and all that. My life has gotten so much better just with this change. If I miss my smartphone, I will consider coming back to it, but I am really pro old phones. At least, I have a strong excuse to be isolated without feeling lonely and recognizing who are the people that really care for me (those that call and send SMS). About A., “the person that stopped talked with me” (funny that reminds me to Voldemort’s nickname: “he who must not be named”). As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, instant messaging is to check that everything is going fine. I am way less empathetic than you, so, if I send a long text talking my mind and then I received three weeks of silence, it is a lot of time to make theories in many directions. A friend also told me the hypothesis of “It is nothing about you” a.k.a. “She is busy”, “Her cat died”, “She lost the phone”, whatever. Anyway, for this, I think like Nietzsche “He who has a why finds a how”. In the hyperconnected world that we inhabit, it is always possible to let other people know that we are alive. And I have to admit that I am pretty bad at that since my mother used to complain about this on the past. Now, she accepted and understood that I am usually fine, that I like to do risky things, that I may or may not be at Brussels at a given point, and that I usually appear in Spain with maximum one-week notice. It started to happen when I was living in Barcelona (at 20 years old) and I was mentioning my trips around Europe with one day of advance, or when I was already in a foreign country, like a spontaneous trip I did to Germany. Thus, I developed a really familiar feeling with travelling around. My mother is fine with knowing about me sporadically or following my social media and knowing that I am alive. I am not saying that is good or bad, but people get used to everything. In the case of A., well, I was worrying. Once, she answered, I could understand better that she is having a busy period and that whatever she experiences there (at the school), she will share it with me if she wants. About you and your “man in the same situation”, life sucks. Well, people suck. Life is fine. If you understand why that guy stopped talking with you, that is fine. Good for you. If you don’t, ask. If he doesn’t answer, people suck. But I have noticed that girls have a stronger conditioning to not taking initiative in many situations, from the first kiss to the first message. Go over it; expose yourself; become vulnerable and change the rules of the game. If it doesn’t work, at least you tried. I don’t want to imagine the amount of suffering that so many girls have caused to themselves for not taking initiative. You know, maybe the guy actually wanted to meet you and talk with you, but you didn’t write that message because girls don’t write messages first. Those are my prejudices. Take them as you want. Last Friday (2019-09-13), I was really down. Today, Monday, I am up again. Leaving the phone aside and re-connecting with my life and who I am had helped me a lot. I wrote some letters to a couple of friends and, although they didn’t answer yet, writing did its magic. Self-confrontation is always helpful. As you said, low moments are pretty good for artistic inspiration. However, they are also shitty, and in this period, I am discovering that creativity can be brought up almost whenever. In any case, the picture you posted on Instagram with the guitar was simply gorgeous. To make the work of future historians easier, here it is11. I am not sure whether pain is good or bad. I read from Jonathan Haidt in The happiness hypothesis that existential crisis in our young adulthood are mentioned as the most meaningful events of our lives later on life. In my case, it was a love rupture and emigrating alone to Denmark. It was painful, it made me grow, and indeed, it has shaped who I am. I miss it somehow. About the Sonian Forest (Fôret de Soignes), it is wonderful. Actually, Friday, I was super nervous, also feeling lonely and shitty, and I took the decision of going from La Hulpe to Brussels by foot, about 14km in a straight line that I didn’t make. I didn’t want to check my phone, just test my brain. Therefore, I got lost. I walked in circles, I climbed fences, and I avoided paths. It was pretty refreshing. I would have loved to do it with someone else, but it was still worthwhile. I cannot say where I was, but it was a wonderful five or six hours walk. I don’t know. I thought about doing it barefoot, to remember A.’s lessons. But I climbed over a fence, I started bleeding from my hands, and I decided to keep it easy. Also, I was in private property at some point, so it would be good to have high-mobility opportunities, just in case. I also realized that not everyone is my friend and that I should protect and invest more in myself and the relationships that I already have. Also, to pay more attention to the people that believe in me. Besides, I forgave some people from my past, which is the spiritual work that I am doing nowadays, and I kept on losing myself. If you feel in pain, write to me. If you feel lonely, write to me. I know pretty well how shitty feels to be felt alone, thinking that no one in this planet cares for you. It is just inaccurate, at least in your case. About your Facebook post. For historians’ shake: “Awareness and acceptance that we are killing the environment is the same as a person who suffers from a serious illness and who knows that he will die soon. If, in fact, nothing lasts forever, then why am I still striving to make it so?” It is pretty hopeless. Hopelessness is a predictor/correlator of depression. My addiction to life is based on my mind clinging to hope. I told many times to myself that I would never commit suicide because I simply don’t know. I don’t know if today on the train I will meet the person of my life. I have the hope that that can happen, and that is why, no matter how shitty I feel, I will keep on trying. I will die trying. I think that your comment is arrogant. It lacks humility. Humility sparks hope. The person that is ill doesn’t know if someone is going to discover the definitive cure that will bring back its health. In the same way, we don’t know if someone is going to bring up the solution for the environmental crisis. Anyway, what we should do is twofold: first, being as careful as possible when living in delicate situations (like being ill, or the highly damaged environment); and secondly, enjoy to the most while it lasts (always keeping the first premise on mind). It doesn’t serve any purpose to enjoy while destroying ourselves. Hedonism manifest way more intensely in a healthy way than in a destructive one. Basically, because you add the layer of meaningful hedonism. You are not doing something that you enjoy, you are doing something that you enjoy, giving an opportunity to others of enjoyment, and giving meaning to your life, which opens up a deeper level of existence. Nothing lasts, forever, indeed. For the shake of historians: RANDOM WISDOM #1. Todo se acaba/Everything finishes – Carlito Fluito. Put subtitles. 2016-11-16, already speaking shit on YouTube. “Todo, todo, todo, todo, todo se acaba.” Anitya. “So, when you realize that everything finishes. You stop thinking that it is bad, and you stop thinking that is good. And you realize that it is what it is. Then, maybe, we learn to suffer a little less…” 2018-08, at the Vipassana, crying, because this universe is going to go through a slowly decaying process of death (Three ways to Destroy the Universe – Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell.) The teacher asked me if I was having strong emotions coming out. “Some…”, I answered. “Life is suffering. (Vipassana, my experience – Carlito Fluito) So, yes, nothing lasts forever, neither life, neither the environment, neither your ideas about the fact that nothing lasts forever. Thus, trying to make it last forever will bring suffering, but accepting it and enjoy what you have now will bring different sensations and emotions to your being. I opt for the second. Some people may say that I am shallow. I think I am practical, pragmatic. Once you go deep, you better become pragmatic if you don’t want to sink. And this is my mind today, after a couple of days without smartphone and feeling very released. Thanks for reading, K.. As I mentioned, I think we should meet (Estonia, Belgium, somewhere else?). I don’t care, and I don’t mind. The relevant people in life should be preserved. That’s it. With the years, I have learned to preserve those that make my life more interesting and enjoyable. You are one of these. So, if you share this with me, choose a place and a date, and let’s improve the quality of our existence, at least for a weekend. After all, we know that everything finishes, and we usually know when things start. But we don’t know what is going to start, and we don’t know when it will finish. Read this twice. Huge hug, CF Although talking with K. was getting easier, and I was already envisioning she and I walking around the forests of Brussels, with you, I was still puzzled about how to figure out your state of mind, and the situation of our relationship. After a week of silence (2019-09-19), when I have tried to put you outside of my head and wait patiently, all indicated that you have forgotten about me. Again. — reminder 🙂 — of what? — about your search of theater schools in Spain — oh thank you for the reminder, i already managed It was still me the one creating and maintaining conversation — good then how are you doing? — sick a bit good in general just needing some rest — it happens body wisdom — yes how are you? I was surprised you had even asked. Still many things were going on with my mind and life, I was questioning what exactly I was doing in Brussels, and what I wanted to do with my life. Using the chance that you had given me, I proposed that we talked. — well ups and downs and downs and ups conflictive selves atemporal shit do you want to talk? Call — i just finished a 2 hour phone talk 😀 — I see Not today, I guessed. My bad luck manifesting. Next time, then… — karolina? — no I founded the trailer of your documentary posted on your Facebook profile. It had Estonian subtitles, so I didn’t understand anything. However, it was uplifting to see you again, at least in the video. It was very exciting to see that work that you have talked me about; to share a bit of that experience that you had told me it had been so relevant, meaningful and life changing. In the trailer, your personality was conveyed, and that messy facet of yourself was reflected in the chaotic aspect of your room on the background. — uuuuuu I don’t understand shit I guess you ordered the room for the video You sent me the website of the project. — there’s one (trailer) with english subtitles nah the mess is on the other side — pffff such a trailer many emotions makes me jealous for your experience, and seeing you is great makes me miss you — 😀 — If you find some time and inspiration to write, I would like to know about you — thank you for the opportunity but i dont even have time to just be at this period — iep, you told it the other time but sickness can be inspirting 😉 otherwise, we can find a day and talk and I am still up to visit you more the “you” with free time than the “you” that cannot “just be” I can be patient thanks for the subtitles — 🙂 I was trying to not be too needy. But I was indeed missing you, and I was watching the trailer of your documentary almost on repeat. Being sucked by its power. I sent you a screen shot where you say “I am a decent woman actually” with that huge smart irony so characteristic of you. You answered me with a picture of yourself in classroom reading some notes. You were wearing your dark shorts, sprawled legs, feet on a window frame, and receiving the sun over your genitals. — How I handle school — getting a tanned pussy? — Yep — good for the root chakra — I was trying to get some sun on my solar plexus — that’s the official version btw, most of your marks healed most — 👍 — Remember your nails in my belly when we were outside taking the sun? — Ye — Remember how we looked into each other’s eyes? — Not really Which look exactly? — I wasn’t seeing my eyes, so I don’t know my look yours was a transition challenge, surprise, vulnerability, worry and finally caring, or love I was holding my breath probably the worry was worry for me realization of the situation — What was the situation — After lunch we moved the tatami on the side of the house not next to the door, but turning right some girls were down in front of the stairs other people on the other side, in front of the door you and me feeling like free sapiens I think we had share the food with the fingers before probably So we moved the tatami and you were over me I was without t-shirt we were loving each other in our way biting, pulling the hair, scratching and all that at some point, I wanted to check how much pain I could endure so I was letting you do more cosmopolitan information you had the idea of putting your nails on my belly then the look and after you kiss me, hug me, I breath hiding my tears of pain, and I think we relaxed — okay i remember It felt good to sexualize the conversation and remember the anecdote together. It seemed we were connecting again. — 🙂 I don’t know if it will go away eventually but it is a bit like India It is a hard drug Anyway what I said It would be good to talk/see/spend time with you I don’t know how you feel about me, or what your thoughts about me are/were before/after my letter and I don’t know how being on the school is changing you I don’t know anything You are good at putting me on this state of surrender you expand me by contracting me daostic paradoxes 😊 — 👍 the letter was quite boring to read That caught me unwarded, but I actually laugh at your straightforwardness and carelessness. Also, it remind me of our lovingly hostile relationship. — hahahahaah thank you for the feedback — but im glad u wrote it, probably in 10 years i will be appreciating it much more — 👍 It is nice that you think with perspective — 👍 — 👍 — 👍 The conversation was becoming pointless.
