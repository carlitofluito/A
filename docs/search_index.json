Carlito Fluito 2020-04-29 1 Prelude 1.1 Sunday, 27 of October of 2019 Fotografiska Restaurant, Telliskivi Loomelinnak, Tallinn, Estonia 14.35 Such a trip, brother. Such a trip. So many things have happened that it is difficult to know where to start… Such a cliché, isn’t it? I am more connected to my friends now, more connected to myself, more connected to the world, more connected to the universe, more connected to life.

I have seen a life now that I want to follow. I have seen a place that fills me with life and good energy. I am in a mood that resonates with who I am. I was in contact with my shadow yesterday. I was ready to witness and participate in death, in violence, in killing, in pain, in suffering, in committing horrendous deeds. I was ready for it. Now, I am ready for something else. "]
