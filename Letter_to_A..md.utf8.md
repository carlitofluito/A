# BOOK II - Distance

This is the evolution of our relationship during our time apart. Here there are some of our messages exchanged through Facebook together with some of my inner processes along this period.

I never send it to you. Until now.

## Preamble {-}

I was raising downwards. 

You were gestating inside my mind.

A sheep in lion’s clothing venturing into the den of a lion in sheep’s clothing. 

## Silence (2019-08-05 to 2019-09-08)

### Back at home (2019-08-05)
I was in Brussels. I wasn’t worrying much about you, since I knew you would get away of pretty much any situation, but I was curious about what had happened.

--- *The night was great. How was your travel?*

<div style="text-align: right"> --- *Sleeping a lot, like what I am doing today. Planning to write something to you soon.  How the night developed?  Anecdote?* </div>
