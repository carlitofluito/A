# DAY 11 – 2019-08-05 - Day

I spend the day doing the garden, sleeping and procrastinating my duties. I let my body recover from such a journey and evolution. 

# DAY 12 – 2019-08-06 - after

I postpone my life, my duties and start writing. 

# DAY 13 – 2019-08-07 - day

After two days of almost uninterrupted writing, I am here. I have some notes to add, but I think that for the moment, I will leave the text as it is. 40 pages of learning and lessons written in 2 days and experienced in 10.

# Day 14 – 2019-08-11 – Reviewing

It has been a week, and it seems an eternity. It seems already so far away and so alien to me. I have spent most of my day reviewing and correcting the text in this bus that is taking me to Vienna, to the next episode of my life. Living is weird, writing is weird, evolving and growing is weird. I am here now, still thanking you for all the things you have done. I hope you have enjoyed reading my experience, and I will be very happy to receive and read yours.

Infinite thanks Alissija for having become part of my life.

Infinite love and protection to you, 

Carlito Fluito
